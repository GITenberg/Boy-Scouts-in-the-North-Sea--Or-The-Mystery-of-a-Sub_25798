<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A PACKAGE VANISHES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Good night!&#8221; exclaimed a lad of about
eighteen peering from the window in a railway
coach. &#8220;This train&#8217;s running on a regular
lake!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Jimmie?&#8221; asked a companion
approaching the first speaker. &#8220;Are
we on a ferry? I still feel the wheels hit the
rail joints.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, now and again we crawl along a
rail&#8217;s length or two,&#8221; admitted the boy, &#8220;but
it&#8217;s mighty slow work! I&#8217;m getting tired!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What place is this, anyway?&#8221; inquired a
third boy coming to the window. &#8220;It looks as
if we&#8217;re going out into the ocean!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t be headed for Holland at this
rate!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We surely are!&#8221; assured the one addressed
as Jimmie. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I can tell you what that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
is! The Belgians cut their dikes and flooded
the country to drive out the Germans. My
dream book says that&#8217;s it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A general laugh greeted this assertion.
Moving about in the limits of the none too
commodious compartment of a European railway
carriage four boys dressed in the well-known
khaki uniforms of the Boy Scouts of
America endeavored to observe the scenery
through the windows.
</p>
<p>To those of our readers who have followed
the adventures of this group of boys as related
in the previous volumes of this series no
introduction is necessary. However, for the
benefit of those who have not been so fortunate,
a word of explanation may not be out
of place at this time. The lads had very recently
been engaged in a man hunt that led
through parts of France and Belgium. They
had visited the trenches of both the French
and German forces and had several times
faced death.
</p>
<p>Just now they were practically prisoners,
having been accorded passage from the German
lines to a neutral port in Holland, where
they expected to take ship for their home town
of New York.
</p>
<p>Ned Nestor, a fine, manly lad, was the
Leader of the Wolf Patrol of New York City,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
Boy Scouts of America. He had been often
selected for difficult work by the Chief of the
United States Secret Service because of his
aptitude for the work. His coolness and
sound judgment had carried himself and his
companions through many difficulties. It was
a mission of this character upon which the
boys had recently engaged and from which
they were now returning.
</p>
<p>Jimmie McGraw, freckle-faced and red-headed,
was a member of the Wolf Patrol of
which Ned was leader. He was an ardent
adherent of Ned&#8217;s. Brought up a newsboy
on the Bowery of New York the boy had come
under the observation of the older lad, who
had found him indeed worthy of all the care
which had been bestowed.
</p>
<p>Jack Bosworth, the son of a prominent corporation
attorney, and Harry Stevens, whose
father was a well-known automobile manufacturer,
were the other members of the group.
These latter two were members of the Black
Bear Patrol of New York. All the lads appeared
to be about eighteen years old. Their
tidy uniforms, their well-knit frames and their
alert attitudes bespoke the constant training
of their leader.
</p>
<p>As they looked from the windows of the
car in which they now found themselves they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
discovered that the situation was even as Jimmie
had stated. The country was flooded with
water released from the dikes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you what,&#8221; declared Jack Bosworth,
after a prolonged inspection of the landscape,
if it may be so called, &#8220;this is some wet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You win the argument,&#8221; announced Jimmie,
wrinkling his freckled nose at his companion.
&#8220;I always said you were the wise little
fox!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s answer to this pleasantry was an
attempt to box the younger lad&#8217;s ears. Jimmie&#8217;s
resentment of the procedure drew the
others into a friendly scuffle that terminated
only when the contestants paused for breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish they&#8217;d hurry up and let us get onto
dry land again!&#8221; said Jimmie, when he next
found himself able to draw a long breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t find much dry land when it
rains like it&#8217;s going to right now!&#8221; stated
Harry, pointing out of the window. &#8220;Watch
it come down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they don&#8217;t get to the border while it
rains like this,&#8221; answered Ned, with an involuntary
shiver. &#8220;I don&#8217;t fancy standing out
in such a drizzle as this appears to be. We&#8217;d
be wet through in no time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, do they make us get out?&#8221; queried
Harry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand from what the officer
said back there at the old castle that we&#8217;ll be
searched body, boots and baggage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what if they find something they don&#8217;t
like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;ll put us in jail for a few
months or until the war has ceased,&#8221; replied
Ned. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Br-r-rh!&#8221; shivered Jimmie. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
turn our old friend The Rat out into a rain
like this! That would be cruelty to animals!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Small chance anyone&#8217;ll have to turn him
out now!&#8221; spoke up Jack. &#8220;That dynamite
fixed him so he won&#8217;t be turned out for some
time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of it, boys,&#8221; protested Ned.
&#8220;I see him yet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s change the subject,&#8221; proposed
Jimmie, out of consideration for his chum&#8217;s
feelings. &#8220;I think I see some land. Can
we be coming to the border I wonder? I
hope we are and that we can soon be starting
home!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Train&#8217;s slackening speed,&#8221; announced
Harry. &#8220;They&#8217;re stopping!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was even as the boy had said. With many
a bump and groan of grinding brakes the train
crawled to a standstill beside a hut built upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
a rise of ground. Here was stationed a force
of soldiers detailed to the work of searching
and examining all who attempted to pass from
Belgium to Holland. Those who were not certified
as refugees or in other ways vested with
proper authority to pass were promptly rejected
and turned back.
</p>
<p>A guard came running along the foot board
opening doors. He shouted instructions to
the inmates of the carriages, who promptly
began scrambling out of the uncomfortable
cars. All baggage was placed along the track
to facilitate examination. The train itself was
searched.
</p>
<p>Gesticulating and conversing rapidly two
soldiers approached the little group of Boy
Scouts. Apparently an argument of some sort
was in progress, but the boys could not determine
the nature of it.
</p>
<p>One of the men pointed to the uniforms and
to the medals upon the sleeves of the boys&#8217;
jackets. Gradually his companion seemed to
be convinced by the flow of words. At length
he nodded his head, as if surrendering his last
doubts. The two men fell to examining the
luggage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go as far as you like, Old Scout!&#8221; scorned
Jimmie, as he observed the rough manner in
which his belongings were being tossed about.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I&#8217;d punch your dome a little, though,
if you could talk English!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, ha!&#8221; cried one of the soldiers, tapping
his comrade on the shoulder, as if his argument
had been conclusively supported. &#8220;Anglaise!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A torrent of words from the other seemed to
meet a receptive ear. The first speaker nodded
energetically. His satisfaction was all too evident.
From his appearance he was expecting
nothing short of a medal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Judging from their motions,&#8221; Jimmie remarked,
&#8220;these two fellows are about to fight
a duel. I&#8217;ll bet on the shorter one!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221; declared Harry. &#8220;They&#8217;re
merely telling one another what a nice day it
was yesterday and how fine the weather&#8217;ll be
when it clears up. They are using the sign
language, that&#8217;s all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you kid yourself!&#8221; protested Jimmie,
uneasily. &#8220;I smell Old Man Trouble
coming around the corner right now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Jimmie!&#8221; scorned Jack. &#8220;You&#8217;re
dreaming again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I am!&#8221; replied the younger lad.
&#8220;Last night I dreamed of eating salt mackerel
and my dream book says that means trouble!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they come now!&#8221; cautioned Ned.
&#8220;Hush a minute, boys!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>Addressing the boys in German the soldier
was evidently asking some question which demanded
an answer. Ned as spokesman shook
his head. The other soldier spoke rapidly in
the French language.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, gentlemen,&#8221; Ned said, lifting
a protesting hand, &#8220;we cannot understand the
language you are using. We speak only English!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, ha! Anglaise!&#8221; cried the soldier, gesticulating.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, you put your foot in it!&#8221; declared
Jimmie. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you say: &#8216;Come across
with some good old United States, Bo&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They probably don&#8217;t understand your
slang, Jimmie!&#8221; replied Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So-o-o,&#8221; exclaimed one of the men in poor
English, &#8220;you speak English, do you? And
from what part of England do you come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not from England at all,&#8221; explained
Ned, &#8220;but from the United States.
We are being sent home by the kindness of a
German officer, who has been most considerate.
See, here are our passports!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; scornfully protested the man.
&#8220;Passports are most easily forged. And information
may be carried still more easily!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I assure you,&#8221; continued Ned, &#8220;we
are speaking the truth!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So say all spies!&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;We
shall see for ourselves just what information
you have in your possessions!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go as far as you like,&#8221; replied Ned, somewhat
nettled at the soldier&#8217;s insolence. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t find a thing that shouldn&#8217;t be there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the men was already bending over
the bags containing such articles as the boys
had deemed necessary for their trip. Without
regard for the owners&#8217; rights he was
rapidly taking out every piece separately.
After carefully examining it he threw the
article on the ground. He was evidently annoyed
at not finding something incriminating.
</p>
<p>Submitting to the search with poorly concealed
dislike of the man and his methods, the
boys waited with what patience they could
muster until the ordeal should be ended. Ned
endeavored to distract their thoughts by commenting
on the others, who were meeting similar
treatment.
</p>
<p>He was interrupted by an exclamation of
delight from the searcher.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried that worthy, standing upright.
&#8220;Nothing contraband! Nothing to be concealed!
No information! These are not
spies!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held in his hand a flat packet wrapped
in heavy oiled silk, tied with many wrappings
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
of stout twine and sealed carefully
with wax.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gather your possessions quickly and follow
me!&#8221; commanded the soldier triumphantly,
drawing a revolver. &#8220;We shall visit
the commander!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that thing and where did it come
from?&#8221; questioned Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me!&#8221; declared Jimmie, excitedly.
&#8220;Maybe this gink had it up his little sleeve
and dropped it in there at the right minute!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks equal to it!&#8221; stated Jack stoutly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a villain!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better be careful what you say!&#8221; cautioned
Ned. &#8220;We are not out of the woods, and these
fellows understand English pretty well!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had my automatic and about ten
yards start!&#8221; stormed Jimmie, gathering up
wearing apparel and jamming it into his kit.
&#8220;I could beat that slow-footed camel in a
straightaway without half trying!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better wait and see it out,&#8221; advised Ned,
replacing his own belongings. &#8220;It&#8217;s only a
mistake and can surely be explained.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we can be examined and go ahead
on this same train,&#8221; offered Jack consolingly.
&#8220;Anyhow, we won&#8217;t gain anything by arguing
with these fellows. They have no sense of
humor and don&#8217;t want one!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Following their two captors the lads trudged
down the track toward the hut. Carefully
they picked their way between groups of
genuine refugees rearranging their meagre
possessions in the coaches.
</p>
<p>In a short time the boys were duly presented
before a gray-haired officer seated at a
table placed against the wall of the hut. It
was darker in the room than out of doors. A
single oil lamp served to dispel the gathering
gloom of the early twilight.
</p>
<p>Reporting volubly in German, with many
gesticulations, the soldier presented the four
boys. At the conclusion of his recital he laid
the parcel upon the table. Drawing himself
to his full height and assuming a tragic air
he surveyed his captives with complacency.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that mark!&#8221; whispered Jimmie
hoarsely. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It says &#8216;U-13&#8217; as plainly as the freckles on
your nose,&#8221; replied Harry, who stood nearest
the table. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it means!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A challenge from the sentry at the door
drew the attention of those within the hut.
For a moment every eye turned toward the
entrance.
</p>
<p>Ever on the alert, Jimmie saw a hand thrust
through the open window. It seized the package
and noiselessly disappeared.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Finding that the disturbance had been
caused by the approach of one of the refugees,
who demanded an audience with the commander,
but who had quickly been satisfied by
the explanation of the sentry, the officer again
gave his attention to the group before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Proceed!&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;You may speak
English for the benefit of these young gentlemen.
Let us have the story, now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Myself and my comrade searched the baggage
of these fellows,&#8221; began the soldier, directing
a contemptuous glance at the boys.
&#8220;When we reached the kit of that one there,&#8221;
here he pointed at Ned, &#8220;we discovered what
seemed to us to be suspicious goods. Here
it is&mdash;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A gasp of astonishment terminated the
triumphant recital.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; ordered the officer without emotion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But a moment ago the package was lying
on your table!&#8221; almost shouted the soldier.
&#8220;Now it is gone!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So I perceive!&#8221; replied the officer. &#8220;If
you have evidence, please produce it. Otherwise
I shall examine the passports of the
young gentlemen, and if they are found correct
I shall permit them to depart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He reached out a hand for the passports,
which were quickly presented. After a minute
scrutiny and careful comparison of descriptions
he returned them to the lads. Again he
turned to the soldier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any evidence of their guilt?&#8221; he
inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe they have stolen the package!&#8221;
stormed the soldier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Search them!&#8221; commanded the officer.
&#8220;With respect!&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>During the hasty but thorough search of the
lads&#8217; clothing Jimmie grinned maliciously into
the faces of the soldiers. His delight knew no
bounds. Their discomfiture upon failing to
find the package was exceeded only by the delight
of the lad, who prudently held his own
counsel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There must have been a mistake!&#8221; at
length declared the officer impatiently. &#8220;We
cannot delay the train longer. Permit them to
proceed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I swear I discovered in their luggage a
suspicious parcel!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is not here! The young gentlemen do
not seem to have it! In the face of their apparently
correct passports and this courteous
request from their friend, von Moltke, I am
not justified in holding them longer! Young
men, you may resume your journey!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thanking the officer in grateful acknowledgment
of his courtesy the lads again found
their compartment. Scarcely had they regained
their former position before the train
again began to move.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Ned,&#8221; began Harry, as the wheels
once more clicked over the rail joints, &#8220;produce!
Let&#8217;s have the secret!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Produce nothing!&#8221; declared Ned. &#8220;I have
nothing to produce!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The package, man, the mysterious package
of contraband spy literature!&#8221; demanded
Harry in a serious tone. &#8220;What secrets are
you carrying out of this country to help the
English?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I have nothing at all! I don&#8217;t
know what that package contained, nor do I
know where it came from!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, too!&#8221; declared Jack. &#8220;But
where did it go to so suddenly? That&#8217;s the
interesting part! What did you do with it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, boys,&#8221; protested Ned, &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t got it. I saw that fellow fish it out of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
my kit. I saw him put it on the table. When
I turned back after glancing at the door the
package was gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that!&#8221; continued Harry. &#8220;Now,
who took it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give a good deal to know that myself!&#8221;
declared Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just how much would you give?&#8221; queried
Jimmie from his seat in a corner from whence
he had been listening. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to make a
stake!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie pinched it!&#8221; cried Harry, pouncing
upon his comrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Deliver that package!&#8221; shouted Jack, going
to the assistance of his chum. &#8220;Search
him, Ned!&#8221; he continued, as Jimmie was
dragged to his feet. &#8220;Go through him carefully
while we hold him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go as far as you like,&#8221; grinned Jimmie
teasingly. &#8220;It&#8217;s not here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it, Jimmie?&#8221; questioned Ned,
seriously, &#8220;let&#8217;s have it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I haven&#8217;t got it!&#8221; declared Jimmie,
still grinning. &#8220;But I saw it when it
disappeared and I know where it went!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; shouted Jack, impatiently.
&#8220;Say something!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It went out of the window of the shanty!&#8221;
declared Jimmie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, go on!&#8221; scorned Harry. &#8220;Just
jumped up and flew away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a laugh Jimmie then related what he
had seen at the moment when all the other
occupants of the hut had been giving their
attention to the disturbance at the front door.
The tale astonished his chums.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the hand as plainly as I see my
own!&#8221; declared Jimmie, holding his hand up
to the light of the single oil lamp. &#8220;It was
the hand of a gentleman, I should say. I mean
by that, it was soft and well kept&mdash;not hard
and calloused. The peculiar mark by which I
shall know it again if I see it was a scar extending
clear across the back. I somehow
connected that scar with a saber or sword cut.
It was an ugly wound.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see anything of the man?&#8221; asked
Ned, eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I wasn&#8217;t turned far enough and I
didn&#8217;t dare move,&#8221; replied Jimmie. &#8220;All at
once I seemed to comprehend that the thief
was saving us a lot of troublesome delay, and
I just let him make his getaway without raising
a holler! I thought he was helping us as
well as himself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we ought to vote Jimmie a credit
mark!&#8221; declared Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly exercised wonderful self-control
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
in not making a noise at a critical time,&#8221;
added Jack. &#8220;I wonder, now, if the chap at
the door made the disturbance to assist the
other fellow in grabbing the parcel. It would
almost seem as if they were working together!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does seem like that!&#8221; stated Ned,
thoughtfully. &#8220;But what puzzles me most is
the fact that the package was in our baggage!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what on earth could have been
in the old &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But ponder and speculate as they might the
lads were unable to arrive at a solution of the
mysterious presence and disappearance of the
package bearing the curious mark. Weary
with the exertion of attempting to solve the
problem the boys at length composed themselves
for sleep.
</p>
<p>Mile after mile the train bumped jerkily
along the uneven track. Occasionally a guard
opened the door to scrutinize the compartment,
but upon finding the little party at rest
he again proceeded to his duties.
</p>
<p>Gradually the train drew away from the
inundated section. To the southward, whence
they had come, the boys were leaving the scene
of the mighty conflict, the like of which history
had never seen. Behind them were the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
trenches filled with soldiers&mdash;some happy and
gay even in the presence of death, others disheartened
and downcast. There, too, they
were leaving the great cannon with their roaring,
screaming shells, the vicious crack of
rifles and the wasp-like singing of bullets.
</p>
<p>Before them in fancy they saw a great ship
upon which they would take passage to the
peace and quietness of their own country.
Their dreams were filled with scenes of New
York and their beloved club room, hung with
trophies of the prowess of the members of
their patrol.
</p>
<p>At Amsterdam they would embark speedily,
and after a week or ten days of ocean travel
would see again the Goddess of Liberty holding
up to the world a beacon to guide their
ships into a haven of peace and plenty.
</p>
<p>Could the boys have pierced the veil and
looked upon the scenes through which they
were soon to pass their rest that night might
not have been so tranquil, their dreams would
perhaps have been less pleasant.
</p>
<p>Thanks to the consideration extended them
at the instance of their friend, von Moltke,
the German officer in whose charge they had
been placed during the last exciting scenes of
their stay in the war zone, the lads had been
accorded the privilege of a whole compartment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
Due to this fact they found room in
which to stretch out as they slept. This exceptional
advantage was fully appreciated.
</p>
<p>Toward morning the boys were awakened
by the bustle surrounding the arrival of the
train at Utrecht. At this point another passenger
was thrust unceremoniously into the
compartment. After performing this duty
the guard hastened away to perform similar
services for others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, gentlemen,&#8221; said the newcomer
pleasantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Top of the morning to you!&#8221; smiled Jimmie,
rising and endeavoring to smooth out the
wrinkles in his uniform. &#8220;How&#8217;s the weather
outside?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearing rapidly, but there&#8217;s promise of
some wind,&#8221; replied the newcomer. &#8220;May I
ask how far you are going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;New York!&#8221; declared Jimmie with a grin.
&#8220;That is,&#8221; his added, &#8220;if this old ark holds
together until we get to Amsterdam and we
can find a ship there. It would be just our
luck to find the last canal boat gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Been having tough luck?&#8221; inquired the
other solicitously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rotten!&#8221; stated the boy. &#8220;How far do
you go?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Amsterdam is my present destination,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
was the reply. &#8220;My name&#8217;s Mackinder&mdash;Robert
Mackinder, and I&#8217;m trying to get out of
this forsaken country, don&#8217;t you know. I&#8217;m
in hopes I&#8217;ll be able to find some craft destined
to a point where I&#8217;ll be able to get home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Introductions of the four lads followed.
Mackinder proved himself an entertaining
talker. Listening to his tales of adventure
in various lands the boys were soon at ease.
The man apparently had traveled over the
whole world for he seemed familiar with all
lands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; declared Jimmie, as their new
found friend concluded a tale of privation
through which he had passed in South Africa,
&#8220;that story of starvation reminds me that I
am hungry. I haven&#8217;t eaten in a week!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie, Jimmie!&#8221; cautioned Ned. &#8220;Get
down to recent dates!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it feels that way, anyhow,&#8221; persisted
the boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell us where we&#8217;ll be able to find
a lunch counter?&#8221; asked Ned. &#8220;We have
nothing in our kits except some hard tack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no place short of Amsterdam
where one can get anything like a decent
meal,&#8221; replied Mackinder. &#8220;There I can
show you the way to a restaurant that is all
right. It is not far from the docks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll get one good, solid, square
meal!&#8221; shouted Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And after breakfast,&#8221; put in Harry, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
go aboard the steamer and let &#8217;em sail as soon
as they like! What shall we eat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a limburger cheese sandwich,&#8221; announced
Jimmie. &#8220;I&#8217;d like it to be on rye
bread with plenty of mustard. Then with a
couple of cups of real old Dutch coffee I guess
I&#8217;d last until noon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By noon we&#8217;ll be out on the North Sea, I
hope,&#8221; stated Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get onto the North Sea direct
from Amsterdam!&#8221; scorned Jack. &#8220;You have
to go through some sort of lake or bay first!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave it to Mr. Mackinder here!&#8221; protested
Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend is right, Harry,&#8221; smiled
Mackinder, thus appealed to. &#8220;Amsterdam
is on the Zuider Zee. If we get a vessel at
that place we will pass northward through
that water, thence between some of the Friesian
Islands into the North Sea. From that
point it is but a short distance to my destination.
Any port in England will be suitable
for my purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nix on England for mine!&#8221; declared Jimmie.
&#8220;I&#8217;m for the little old United States
every time. We are neutral there without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
having to think about it. I&#8217;m about done with
war. I&#8217;ve seen enough!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much is plenty, as the Dutchman
says,&#8221; put in Harry. &#8220;But about this Amsterdam
place, now. Do you know the town,
Mr. Mackinder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I do!&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I have
been there many times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you&#8217;d be good enough to
give us a little help. You see, we&#8217;re strangers
there and since we&#8217;ve lost our airship we&#8217;re
almost helpless. We&#8217;re not accustomed to
finding our way about where the inhabitants
don&#8217;t speak English. Besides, we&#8217;re not provided
with a map.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted to help you in any way
possible,&#8221; continued the man. &#8220;I think that
if you follow me you&#8217;ll have little trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lads gladly availed themselves of this
offer, and shortly after their arrival at the
city they found themselves in a room plainly
but comfortably furnished. From their windows
they could see the shipping in the harbor.
Before them a busy street teemed with
traffic.
</p>
<p>Watching the strange sights below the boys
were startled to hear:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll trouble you now for the &#8216;U-13&#8217; package!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>Wheeling quickly they were frightened to
observe that Mackinder had them covered
with a revolver. His look was stern and determined.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE MAN WITH THE SCAR</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What package is it you want?&#8221; inquired
Ned in amazement as he saw that Mackinder
evidently intended to enforce his demand at
all costs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall countenance no delay!&#8221; spoke the
man sharply. &#8220;You may step to your luggage
there and produce that package instantly. If
you refuse I shall summon assistance and it
will be taken forcibly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the wrong pig by the ear this
time, partner!&#8221; put in Jimmie. &#8220;Just put up
your little cannon. It won&#8217;t do you any good
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough!&#8221; snapped Mackinder. &#8220;You will
gain nothing by attempting such methods. I
am not to be balked by trivialities!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Boss,&#8221; smiled Jimmie, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t
got any &#8216;U-13&#8217; package and we haven&#8217;t got
any of those other things, either!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I warn you,&#8221; went on Mackinder in a
menacing tone, &#8220;it has become known to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
authorities that you have this package. I have
been commissioned to secure it. If you surrender
it before leaving this country you will
lose nothing. If you refuse it will be taken
by force. In that case you need not expect to
receive any degree of clemency in the matter!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Mackinder,&#8221; began Ned with dignity,
&#8220;we don&#8217;t understand what you mean. If you
intend to infer that we have some mysterious
package that we should not have you are not
fair to us. Perhaps you would like to examine
our luggage and be sure it is not there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; stated Mackinder grimly. &#8220;If
you insist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Keeping the revolver leveled in the direction
of the group the man stepped to the side
of the room. He grasped the old-fashioned
bell-pull. In answer to his summons steps
were heard approaching the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, there you are, Norton,&#8221; sighed
Mackinder in a relieved tone as a man in uniform
appeared. &#8220;Just keep an eye on these
chaps, will you. I&#8217;m going through their luggage.
Look sharp, now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>From Norton&#8217;s appearance the boys judged
that the task was much to his liking. He fingered
a wicked looking revolver, as if anticipating
trouble and hoping that would come
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
quickly. His manner was that of an eager
hunting dog scenting game and only waiting
a command to attack.
</p>
<p>Thinking it best to offer no resistance and
understanding that arguments would not avail
under the present circumstances Ned seated
himself in a convenient chair. He began to
divert the minds of his comrades by talking
of the shipping and the traffic which they
could see.
</p>
<p>Hastily Mackinder tossed the luggage about
in his efforts to locate the article he sought.
Finally he turned to Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you concealed it?&#8221; he asked
with some display of anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Concealed what?&#8221; asked Ned impatiently.
&#8220;I tell you, Mr. Mackinder, I don&#8217;t like this
idea of your holding us up in this manner
without apparent authority. You are imposing
on good nature!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I have been a little hasty,&#8221; stated
Mackinder, &#8220;but I have been commissioned
to secure a certain package which is alleged to
contain information vital to two countries. It
may possibly concern more. You are said to
have had possession of this package at the
time you left the castle in Flanders. Where
is it now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean the flat package the soldier
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
found in our baggage at the frontier where
we were searched?&#8221; inquired Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt it is the same one,&#8221; stated
Mackinder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; declared the boy, pointing at
Mackinder&#8217;s hand, &#8220;I have every reason to
believe that you know more about the whereabouts
of that package than do we. I recognize
that peculiar scar on your hand!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Quick glances of inquiry were directed by
the boys at the hand toward which Jimmie
was pointing. It bore a scar running clear
across the back&mdash;an ugly, jagged scar that
they had heard Jimmie describe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you mean by coming here and
trying to throw a bluff into us about the package
still being in our kits when you yourself
took it from the table in the hut?&#8221; demanded
Jimmie aggressively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mistaken, boys, I don&#8217;t know what
you&#8217;re talking about!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve got a mighty poor memory!&#8221;
declared the lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Mackinder,&#8221; Ned said in a low tone
vibrant with indignation, &#8220;if you&#8217;ve quite satisfied
yourself that we have not got the package
you seem to be seeking we&#8217;ll excuse you.
We don&#8217;t want your company any more, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
we shall try to proceed upon our journey
alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, see here, boys&mdash;&#8221; Mackinder attempted
to explain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not another word!&#8221; cried Ned rising.
&#8220;There is the door and you are at liberty to
use it quickly. You are welcome to the package!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find out later on,&#8221; Mackinder
said, as he started to leave the room in company
with Norton, &#8220;that I&#8217;ve been trying to
help you out of mighty suspicious circumstances.
You are ungrateful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye!&#8221; called out Jimmie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
slam the door!&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment the boys gazed at one another
in amazement after the two men had left the
room. They were excited and puzzled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is a stunner!&#8221; declared Ned at
length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this Mackinder, who is Norton,
what is in this &#8216;U-13&#8217; package that he wants,
how did it get into our baggage, why was it
put there, where are we going, when do we
eat!&#8221; demanded Jimmie in a breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to talk, Jimmie!&#8221; cried
Harry, laughing in spite of the situation that
the boys all felt to be a serious one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The last question is the most important!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
stated Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;m in favor of the eats part
and that without further delay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, boys,&#8221; suggested Ned. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
eat first and talk things over afterward. I&#8217;m
nearly famished myself, and Jimmie is hungry,
too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a short time the lads were seated in a
quaint restaurant ordering strange dishes.
They were hungry, as only healthy, active
boys can be. The food was well cooked and
appetizing. They ate heartily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m in favor of getting to the docks
as quick as possible,&#8221; announced Jimmie,
pushing his plate away. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get our passage
settled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All were in favor of this arrangement.
After paying for their breakfast the lads set
out in search of a ship upon which they might
secure passage to the United States. But they
were not to secure this easily.
</p>
<p>Extended inquiry during the forenoon
elicited the information that there was no vessel
clearing from the port of Amsterdam for
any place in America. Although they made
every effort to find a steamer which would
afford them the accommodations they sought
none was found.
</p>
<p>Inquiry at the railway station disclosed the
fact that their airship, the Grey Eagle, now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
dismantled and packed in boxes, was at the
freight sheds waiting a claimant. Until they
could find a vessel to carry it home the boys
preferred to let it remain in its present location.
</p>
<p>After dinner they continued their inquiries
for a vessel. At length they learned of a full-rigged
three-masted ship that was to clear in
a few days for New York. Regretting even
this short delay the lads decided to attempt to
secure passage, although the journey would
be a long one.
</p>
<p>Ned secured the services of a boatman, who
offered to row them out to the ship, which lay
at anchor in the harbor. The man charged
them what the boys considered an extraordinary
price for the service, but explained
that the weather was unfavorable and that at
any moment a storm might break. To this
the boys could but agree. A glance at the sky
convinced them that a storm of rather unusual
violence was gathering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take him up, anyhow, Ned!&#8221; urged Harry.
&#8220;We want to get home!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, here goes!&#8221; declared Ned,
stepping aboard the waterman&#8217;s craft. &#8220;Pull
away, my friend, we&#8217;re all aboard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a short time the man was threading his
way amongst the shipping in the harbor.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
From their position so low upon the water the
masts and spars of the vessels looked to be of
extraordinary height to the boys, who viewed
every object with keen interest.
</p>
<p>A hail from the boatman was answered by
a man from the deck of the ship. He thrust
his head over the rail inquiringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your captain?&#8221; asked Ned, as the
man appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want of the captain?&#8221; asked
the man in a surly voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to talk with him,&#8221; replied Ned.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll explain to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s busy now and don&#8217;t want to be disturbed.
Tell me what you want and I&#8217;ll give
him your message. Maybe he&#8217;ll see you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to arrange passage on your ship
to the United States.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see what he&#8217;s got to say,&#8221; replied the
man, moving away.
</p>
<p>While he was gone the boys examined the
vessel closely. Jimmie pronounced the vessel
very much to his liking. He admired the lines
and pointed with pride to the modeling of the
stern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; the boy cried excitedly, his arm
extended still in the act of indicating the ship,
&#8220;there goes our friend Mackinder in a
launch!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Ned eagerly, turning
about in his seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right astern of us!&#8221; replied Jimmie. &#8220;I
wonder what he was doing aboard this ship.
He seems to be in a hurry to get ashore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he wasn&#8217;t on this ship at all,&#8221; was
Harry&#8217;s objection. &#8220;He might have been out
on the harbor for a pleasure ride.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, he&#8217;s just the chap to take a pleasure
ride on the harbor with a storm brewing! I&#8217;ve
got a picture of that chap joy-riding!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he doesn&#8217;t see us,&#8221; declared Jack.
&#8220;He might have enough influence with the
captain to prevent our securing passage on
this ship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The conversation was interrupted by the
advent of the captain, who looked over the rail
at the little craft riding alongside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he inquired in a business-like
tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to arrange passage on your ship
to New York, Captain,&#8221; stated Ned respectfully.
&#8220;We understand you are to sail soon.
We are citizens of the United States homeward
bound. Can you help us out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not this trip!&#8221; decided the captain instantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are able to pay well for our accommodations,&#8221;
continued the boy. &#8220;It is rather important
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
that we get home as quickly as possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; returned the captain shortly.
</p>
<p>Nonplussed, Ned was at a loss to find words
with which to urge his request further. The
captain&#8217;s distant manner gave him no encouragement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll not be the slightest trouble, Captain,&#8221;
the lad presently continued. &#8220;We understand
you&#8217;ll be loaded in a few days and
will sail for New York direct. Cannot you
arrange to accommodate us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a passenger vessel,&#8221; stated the
captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, couldn&#8217;t we sign articles and
work our way over? We&#8217;d be willing to pay
whatever you think is right for that privilege.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to get me into trouble with the
authorities, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; replied the other, preparing
to move away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Captain, just think a moment. There
must be some way in which you can arrange
it. Don&#8217;t leave us in a foreign country!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have done pretty well in foreign
countries as it is! If you can pull off the
stunts you have just done I guess you&#8217;ll get
over to New York all right&mdash;if that&#8217;s where
you want to go!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? I don&#8217;t understand
you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t, eh? Well, to put it plainly,
this is a peaceable, neutral ship doing honest
trading. I carry freight, not spies!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With these words the captain disappeared.
The boys gasped in astonishment at the words
and looked at each other speechless.
</p>
<p>Ned motioned to the boatman to return to
the dock. His puzzled frown showed plainly
that the boy was at a loss to understand the
situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221; almost shouted Jimmie, as
the lads were once more on land. &#8220;I know
what the answer is! I&#8217;ve been reading my little
dream book!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, wise man, let&#8217;s have it! Don&#8217;t
keep it bottled up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinder!&#8221; declared Jimmie impressively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that he beat us to
the ship and managed to get the captain to
refuse us passage on his vessel?&#8221; asked Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;m right at that!&#8221; maintained
Jimmie, stoutly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the only thing we can do is to try to
find some coasting vessel to carry us out of the
Zuider Zee into the North Sea and make a
port in England. We can then go overland to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
Liverpool and get a ship from there home.
Suppose we try that?&#8221; offered Ned.
</p>
<p>The boys were passing along a covered dock
at the moment. As they turned a corner they
saw Mackinder standing near. A smile of
triumph lighted his face.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE LENA KNOBLOCH</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell you?&#8221; inquired Jimmie, as
the boys passed the man. &#8220;There he stands
with his arms folded and grins like a cream
stealing cat! I wish I had a half a brick!
We&#8217;ll have to watch out for him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It surely looks as if you were right, Jimmie!&#8221;
assented Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what gets me,&#8221; put in Harry, &#8220;is why
he should be after us! What have we done?
He seems to have information that we&#8217;re criminals!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks mighty strange that he should
have stolen the package out of that hut and
then continue to insist that we have it,&#8221; remarked
Ned. &#8220;Are you sure he&#8217;s the same
fellow, Jimmie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the very same hand,&#8221; declared the lad,
&#8220;and that hand is a dead give away! I wonder
he didn&#8217;t wear a glove or bandage!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he didn&#8217;t have time when he got
the package,&#8221; explained Jack. &#8220;Can anyone
tell me how the thing got into our kits?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>This question was unanswerable by any of
the lads. Puzzling over the strange adventures
they had recently encountered the lads
proceeded to their hotel, where they spent
some time in freshening both themselves and
their uniforms and in rearranging their baggage.
</p>
<p>At supper time they were tired and very
hungry. At the first opportunity they proceeded
to the restaurant where they had formerly
eaten.
</p>
<p>Jimmie&#8217;s spirits revived as food was set before
them. In a moment he was laughing and
chatting away without a care in the world.
His good humor was infectious. Soon all four
boys were in a merry mood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we could get a civilized paper,&#8221; declared
Jack at length. &#8220;I&#8217;d really like to see
what&#8217;s going on in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we can get one at the desk. Or possibly
the cashier can tell us where they will
have English papers for sale,&#8221; suggested
Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes a man who looks as if he were
a native,&#8221; spoke up Jimmie. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet he can
tell us a whole lot of things we want to
know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys glanced up to observe a man approaching
their table. He was evidently a seafaring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
man. His dress and manner betokened
the deep sea mariner. A decided air of the
ocean marked him to the boys&#8217; eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goot efening, Chentlemen!&#8221; the stranger
said as he approached.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy!&#8221; replied Jimmie, with a wave of
his hand. &#8220;What&#8217;ll you have?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vell,&#8221; replied the visitor, &#8220;schnapps vas
goot, but you couldn&#8217;t get &#8217;em here. Dis isn&#8217;t
no blace for dot! No, sir!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t inviting you to have a drink,&#8221;
snapped Jimmie somewhat confusedly, &#8220;I
meant to ask you what&#8217;s on your mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So-o-o-o!&#8221; exclaimed the newcomer with
a long drawn expression of surprise. His
shaggy eyebrows raised as he extended his
chin and shrugged his shoulders, pantomiming
an apology. &#8220;So, dot&#8217;s it, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221; answered Jimmie, regaining
his composure in a measure but with his face
still flushed. &#8220;We want to know what you&#8217;re
after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vell,&#8221; went on the visitor, &#8220;my name&#8217;s
Captain Johannes von Kluck. Don&#8217;d forgot
dot &#8216;Captain&#8217; part, eider. Und I haf learned
dot you chentlemans vas lookin&#8217; for a fine, fast
ship. Und I have chust dot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he made this announcement Captain von
Kluck smiled a wide look of friendship at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
entire party. It was a wonderful smile, beginning
at the tiny wrinkles surrounding the
corners of his eyes. From there it spread all
over his face, gradually distorting the features
until, as Jimmie afterward declared, the
boys were forced to smile in spite of themselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And where does your fine ship go, Captain
von Kluck?&#8221; asked Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chust vherefer you vant to go!&#8221; declared
the captain solemnly. &#8220;Me, I am a goot navigator,
und mine mate he is, too, a goot von!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to go to New York,&#8221; continued
Ned. &#8220;If you can arrange to furnish us passage
to that port, we&#8217;ll pay you well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this the captain answered by spreading
his hands and shrugging his shoulders until
they nearly reached his ears. Over his beaming
face spread a look of despair. He slowly
shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To New York I cannot go!&#8221; he answered
dolefully. &#8220;Bud I vill put you ashore in England,
und from dere you can easy get a ship!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s better than nothing at all!&#8221;
admitted Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; declared Jimmie. &#8220;Anything to
get out of this place!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When can you be ready to sail, Captain?&#8221;
inquired Ned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who, me?&#8221; questioned the captain in a
tone of surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody else but you, your crew and we
boys!&#8221; laughed Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Dot&#8217;s all ridt!&#8221; nodded von Kluck.
&#8220;Vhell, I&#8217;m ready now. Yet I haf some
cheeses on board to put, und some odder
tings!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you accommodate the boxes containing
our airship?&#8221; asked Jimmie. &#8220;We have
the Grey Eagle over here at the railroad station
and don&#8217;t want to leave it behind us when
we leave the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it vould on de schip go!&#8221; consented
von Kluck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; exultantly cried the lads.
&#8220;That&#8217;s fine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How big is your ship, Captain?&#8221; asked
Ned, &#8220;and what&#8217;s her name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine schip is der Lena Knobloch!&#8221; smiled
the captain. &#8220;Dot&#8217;s vot you English beoples
call garlic. Und id vas a goot schip alreaty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; suggested Ned, &#8220;suppose the
captain takes supper here as our guest. Two
of us will remain with him to arrange details
while the other two hasten away and get a
truck to take the boxes to the dock. Can you
give us directions for reaching the vessel, Captain?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; assented the captain, seating himself.
&#8220;Und I know a man vot vould haul your
goots, too. I get him,&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, we&#8217;ll all go over together,&#8221;
proposed Jack. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the idea of separating
while we&#8217;re in a strange town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the captain can tell us where we
can get some English papers,&#8221; ventured Jimmie.
&#8220;We&#8217;d like to get the latest news.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wheeling in his chair the captain bawled
out an order in Dutch. A waiter came bustling
up with an air of deference. Evidently he
knew the captain and understood that no delay
would be tolerated.
</p>
<p>A few words were rapidly spoken, whereupon
the waiter hastened away to return presently
with several newspapers. These were
spread upon the table before the boys, who
began a perusal of their contents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee whiz!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmie, glancing at
the headlines of the paper which had fallen
to his lot. &#8220;Listen to this&mdash;three vessels sunk
in the mouth of the Mersey river by a German
submarine identified as the &#8216;U-13.&#8217; Then
there&#8217;s been two vessels sunk at the mouth
of the Thames!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What sunk them?&#8221; inquired Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It says here that they were sunk by a German
submarine. In each case the diver has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
been identified as the &#8216;U-13&#8217; by the crews of
the ill-fated vessels. Now, that&#8217;s going
some!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; pondered Harry, &#8220;the Thames
is the river leading to London, while the
Mersey is the river leading to Liverpool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Old Scout, go to the head
of the class!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Jimmie, no nonsense!&#8221; cautioned
Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I was thinking about,&#8221; continued
Harry, &#8220;is the distance a boat would have to
travel to get from one place to the other. It
must be all of seven hundred miles around
Land&#8217;s End. A boat would have to be speedy
to cover that distance so quickly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How quickly?&#8221; demanded Jimmie. &#8220;The
paper says the three ships were sunk at the
Mersey on Wednesday morning. Those at the
Thames, or rather &#8216;off Margate,&#8217; as the article
states, were sunk Thursday afternoon. That
wouldn&#8217;t be such an impossible feat after
all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty miles an hour sustained speed for
about twenty-eight hours is running along at
a pretty good clip, just the same!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the vessel did it!&#8221; declared Jimmie.
&#8220;The paper says that about six o&#8217;clock
Wednesday morning the Wanderer, a vessel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
laden with foodstuffs from Australia, was
hailed by the crew of a submarine. They were
permitted to take to the small boats and then
the Wanderer was torpedoed, going down at
once. The submarine was positively identified
as the &#8216;U-13.&#8217; Then the other paragraph
says that at about eight o&#8217;clock on Thursday
evening the steamer Adventure from Buenos
Ayres with a cargo of flour for London was
treated in the same manner off Margate by
the &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a little strange that the submarine
should have attacked a peaceful merchant vessel?&#8221;
inquired Jack. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t war!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently it is the intention to blockade
all English ports and shut off the food supply
of the nation,&#8221; ventured Ned. &#8220;You see the
article relates that all the ships were loaded
with food and destined to English ports. It
must be a blockade movement!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s an account,&#8221; announced Harry,
&#8220;that says a steamer was hailed by a submarine
a few miles off the Lizard Head. It
escaped by its superior speed, but only by a
narrow margin, for the submarine launched
a torpedo that barely missed striking the after
portion of the ship!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it was the same little old &#8216;U-13,&#8217;&#8221;
suggested Jimmie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221; laughed Jack. &#8220;You&#8217;re
some boat, all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; shouted Jimmie, jumping quickly
to his feet. The boy glanced about the group
with startled looks. &#8220;What about that &#8216;U-13&#8217;
package? Do you suppose it was intended for
the submarine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys exchanged puzzled looks. Perplexity
was expressed in every face. A look
of worry began to appear on Ned&#8217;s countenance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder who Mackinder is and what he
has to do with that package,&#8221; the lad said
presently. &#8220;Boys, we&#8217;re surely stumbling
into a mess of something. We&#8217;ll have to be
careful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; demanded Jimmie, turning to
von Kluck, &#8220;what do you know about this
&#8216;U-13&#8217; business? What is the &#8216;U-13&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leaning back in his chair the captain drew
a long breath. He filled a great pipe from a
capacious pouch. Gravely he packed the tobacco
into the immense bowl, accompanying
the procedure with sundry shakes of his head.
Not until the pipe was drawing freely did he
reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ach, id vas vot der Deutsch say it &#8216;Unterseeboot&#8217;!
You English say it submarine!
Und dot liddle schip goes &#8216;Boom&#8217;! und down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
goes der big schips under der vasser! Und
dey stay, too!&#8221; he concluded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we know that,&#8221; assented Jimmie,
punctuating his statement with a poke at the
paragraph he had just read, &#8220;but who owns it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhell, der Chermans dey claim to haf a
big share in id!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if we start out for England in this
Lena Knobloch of yours how do we know that
the &#8216;U-13&#8217; won&#8217;t come along and take a poke
at us just out of pure spite?&#8221; questioned the
lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhell, maybe she vill,&#8221; agreed von Kluck,
between puffs. &#8220;Bud if you vhas like me, you
iss willing to took a chance. I go, und das
Lena goes, und by und by maybe we make
blenty money und go ashore to shtay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You take it easy, I must say!&#8221; returned
Jimmie, somewhat amused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going out just the same, Captain?&#8221;
inquired Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; proclaimed the captain, in no uncertain
tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s be getting that truck and take
the Grey Eagle boxes aboard the Lena Knobloch!&#8221;
cried Jack. &#8220;The sooner it&#8217;s over the
easier I&#8217;ll feel. I&#8217;m beginning to get nervous
about all this &#8216;U-13&#8217; business!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>After paying their bill the boys set out in
company with the captain to find the trucker.
That individual put up a strong protest at taking
out his horses at the unseemly hour, but
a piece of coin slipped into his hand at the
opportune moment by Ned soon changed his
mind.
</p>
<p>Another piece of money changing hands at
the proper moment secured the consent of the
official in charge of the freight sheds to the delivery
of the boxes containing the precious
Grey Eagle.
</p>
<p>Making the affair a pleasure jaunt the lads
lost no time in loading the cases aboard the
truck. Merrily they set off for the dock.
</p>
<p>Upon arriving in the vicinity of his vessel
the captain shed his jovial air like an overcoat.
He bawled out orders to his crew, emphasizing
his commands with sundry fistic punctuations.
The men evidently knew with whom they had
to deal, for they fell to the work with a will.
</p>
<p>The boys turned back to the hotel to secure
their hand baggage.
</p>
<p>A small cart drawn by two huge dogs was
approaching. In the vehicle were some milk
cans. The figure of a woman guided the
strange team.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is rather early for the milklady!&#8221;
laughed Jimmie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no woman!&#8221; declared Jack. &#8220;Look
at that walk!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Mackinder!&#8221; Jimmie cried. &#8220;See
the scar on his hand!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>TWO MYSTERIOUS CHANGES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hey, you!&#8221; shouted Jimmie, dashing
across the street in the direction of the queer
outfit. &#8220;Come here! I want to see you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The pseudo milk vendor gave a quick glance
at the approaching boy. A street lamp cast a
flickering glare upon the automatic which Jimmie
had drawn from his pocket. Without
waiting to explain or ask questions the person
addressed deserted the dog team instantly.
</p>
<p>With but a single look over its shoulder the
figure darted toward a building at the head of
the quay. Boots clattered on the pavement,
while the long stride clearly indicated to the
boys that Jimmie and Jack had been correct
in their surmise that the garb of a woman milk
vendor had been assumed as a disguise.
</p>
<p>Although Jimmie&#8217;s speed was great, the
lad&#8217;s sprint was not sufficient to permit him to
overtake his quarry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll never make it!&#8221; declared Jack, tugging
away at his own automatic and preparing
to follow his comrade.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows, let&#8217;s get a move on!&#8221;
suggested Harry. &#8220;That fellow will just
about get into a corner somewhere and knock
Jimmie over the head. He&#8217;s capable of worse
than that, I believe!&#8221;
</p>
<p>All three lads hastened after the fleeing figure
of their red-headed chum and the one
whom he was pursuing.
</p>
<p>An open door in the building indicated that
the race had turned in that direction. Producing
an electric searchlight Ned urged caution.
Directly the lads heard the sound of a
falling body. This was at once followed by
an exclamation of surprise and disgust. They
recognized the tones as those of their companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you there, Jimmie?&#8221; called Ned,
swinging the beam from his searchlight about
the interior, lighting up a collection of merchandise
piled in the warehouse. Jimmie was
nowhere to be seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where could he have gone so suddenly?&#8221;
queried Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Mackinder hit him over the head!&#8221;
ventured Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinder better be careful how he monkeys
with this crew!&#8221; was Harry&#8217;s belligerent
comment. &#8220;Maybe that guy&#8217;ll get all that&#8217;s
coming to him and get it right in the neck!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>For a moment the boys stood listening intently
for some indication of the presence of
their comrade. Once Ned thought he heard a
soft footfall. He put out his hand to touch
Jack on the arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ss-s-sh!&#8221; he hissed. &#8220;What was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rat, maybe!&#8221; suggested Jack. &#8220;Turn
your searchlight this way a minute. I want
to see where this passage leads.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ned swung the searchlight in the direction
indicated. Its lance of flame pierced the
gloom, revealing tiers of boxes and piles of
bags and bales heaped up in orderly array.
Sufficient space had been left between the
heaps of merchandise to provide passageway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; cried Jack, &#8220;we&#8217;re losing time
standing here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Scarcely had the boy uttered the words ere
an object came hurtling through the air. It
struck the searchlight fairly upon the lens.
There was a quick cry of distress from Ned,
a rattle of broken glass, the tinkle of the falling
searchlight. For a moment complete
silence reigned. The next instant there was a
rush of a heavy body.
</p>
<p>Taken by surprise the boys were not prepared
for the onslaught. They went down
like ten pins. Harry received a blow on the
jaw that nearly put him out for the count.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Jack declared afterwards that his stomach
would never cease aching from the punch that
landed there.
</p>
<p>Ned had been bringing up the rear of the
little party, hence suffered least. He felt
about quickly for the searchlight as he lay on
the floor. Before he could recover it the boys
heard the outer door slam and knew that someone
had passed out of the building after the
sudden attack. Who it might have been they
could only conjecture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my poor jaw!&#8221; groaned Harry. &#8220;I&#8217;m
knocked out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not!&#8221; protested Ned. &#8220;That
only shook you up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; agreed Jack. &#8220;Shook us all up so
we&#8217;ll get a little more &#8216;pep&#8217;. Let&#8217;s hurry up
and follow that guy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; objected Ned. &#8220;We want
to find Jimmie first!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-O!&#8221; agreed Harry. &#8220;I think my jaw
is better now. Where are we going, anyway?
Do you suppose that was Jimmie that floored
us just now? Maybe he thought Mackinder
had pals coming in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; stated Ned. &#8220;Jimmie
must have known that Mackinder was alone
with the milk wagon. He also knew that we
would follow him here. Possibly the lad is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
farther along in the warehouse, lost amongst
this merchandise. That must have been
Mackinder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Ned!&#8221; declared Jack. &#8220;He
probably misled Jimmie in here and then
dashed out as we came in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where is Jimmie now?&#8221; queried
Harry. &#8220;I don&#8217;t hear him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jimmie!&#8221; called Ned in a loud tone.
</p>
<p>To this hail there was no answer. Complete
silence reigned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty funny!&#8221; puzzled Harry.
&#8220;Get your searchlight and let&#8217;s hunt him up.
He can&#8217;t have gotten far away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A short search by all three boys resulted in
the recovery of the searchlight. Beyond the
damaged lens the instrument had suffered no
injury. It was still serviceable and cast a
strong beam of light.
</p>
<p>By its aid the lads followed the passage,
stepping rapidly forward. They were becoming
alarmed over the failure of their chum to
respond to their calls. All feared that
Mackinder might have done the lad harm.
Momentarily their anxiety increased.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a side passage!&#8221; declared Harry,
who brought up the rear of the little procession.
&#8220;Where does this go?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute with that searchlight,
Ned!&#8221; called Jack, who followed Ned closely.
&#8220;Throw it back here a minute for Harry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before the light could be brought into service
Harry had taken a step into the passage
he had just discovered. A sharp cry of surprise
brought Jack and Ned to his side in an
instant.
</p>
<p>The lads saw Harry bending over the form
of their missing chum. Jimmie lay in a heap,
blocking the passageway.
</p>
<p>Fearful that their first suspicions had been
correct, the boys scarcely dared investigate.
Jack began growling out uncomplimentary
remarks concerning Mackinder. Ned quickly
forced his way to Harry&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, let me see him!&#8221; Ned cried, throwing
the flame of his searchlight on the recumbent
form. &#8220;Why, he&#8217;s all huddled up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All in a bunch!&#8221; agreed Harry. &#8220;I wonder
if he&#8217;s hurt!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Roll him over,&#8221; directed Ned. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get
him out of here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s tied!&#8221; cried Harry, in a startled
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tied?&#8221; questioned Jack, pushing forward.
&#8220;Who tied him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And gagged!&#8221; went on Harry, his voice
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
vibrating with indignation. &#8220;Mackinder will
pay for this!&#8221; the lad continued. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get
him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without the loss of a moment Harry was
swiftly relieving Jimmie of the object which
prevented speech. A small block of wood had
been forced between Jimmie&#8217;s teeth. This had
been secured in place by tying a handkerchief
over his face. The gag had been extremely
effective, even though it was uncomfortable
and crude.
</p>
<p>As the gag was removed Jimmie wagged his
jaw a few times to relieve the strained muscles.
He nodded his appreciation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you feeling, Jimmie?&#8221; was Ned&#8217;s
solicitous inquiry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied the lad. &#8220;Untie my
hands, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, but you&#8217;re an artist, Jimmie!&#8221; cried
Jack. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get you a job as &#8216;Tricko, The
Handcuff King&#8217;! I want to say right now,&#8221;
the boy went on in mock seriousness, &#8220;there
are very few people who can tie themselves up
so completely and so quickly as this job has
been done!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You win the argument!&#8221; decided Jimmie,
ironically. &#8220;If I get my tutor where I can lay
hands on him I&#8217;ll show him a trick or two that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
wasn&#8217;t in the first chapter. He&#8217;s in for some
instruction all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened, Jimmie?&#8221; asked Ned,
carefully passing his knife through the bonds
that confined the other&#8217;s hands and feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when I came slamming along into
the warehouse I was only a few feet behind
the milk maid!&#8221; began Jimmie. &#8220;I at once
crept in on tiptoe, because I reasoned that he
would be slugging along, making considerable
noise. I didn&#8217;t know that there were goods
in here.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see him anywhere. From that I
concluded that he had either stopped or had
taken to tiptoeing, too. I had my &#8216;gat&#8217; ready
and started in. I felt along the bales and
boxes a ways. Just as I heard you fellows
come into the door something tripped me and
down I went.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I could say a word he had shoved
that thing into my mouth, pulled a handkerchief
out of my pocket, tied it around my face
and then tied my hands together under my
knees. Say,&#8221; the lad continued earnestly,
&#8220;that guy never got his knowledge out of a
correspondence course! He&#8217;s been there and
helped skin &#8217;em! He&#8217;s smooth!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your automatic?&#8221; asked Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Jimmie. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
have the bug a minute. I&#8217;m sure I heard it
fall, but I can&#8217;t say whether Mackinder got
it or not!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinder?&#8221; questioned Ned. &#8220;How do
you know it was he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because as he was tying my hands together
I had a chance to feel of the back of
his right hand. I could feel the scar as plainly
as could be. It was the same scar I saw before
he started to run and the same scar I
saw when the &#8216;U-13&#8217; package was pinched!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to take a poke at him just for
luck!&#8221; declared Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; stated Jimmie.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t help but admire a fellow as capable
as he is. He tied me up so quickly and cleverly
and yet so effectively. I&#8217;d like to take
lessons of him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your gun!&#8221; joyously announced
Harry. &#8220;And here&#8217;s the milkmaid&#8217;s dress he
shed in here after he trussed you up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; began Ned, as the party was
again complete and ready for action, &#8220;let&#8217;s get
out of here and get our baggage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get Mackinder first,&#8221; proposed Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I vote &#8216;No&#8217; on that question, Mr. Chairman!&#8221;
declared Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; questioned Jack, with surprise.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there are several matters!&#8221; declared
Jimmie. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel that we&#8217;d gain anything
by chasing him. The &#8216;U-13&#8217; package is
not in our possession and he knows it. Besides,
he&#8217;s a clever guy and we might get the
worst of it if we step out of our way to go after
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with Jimmie,&#8221; announced Ned.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s get aboard the Lena Garlic and get
started on our way as soon as possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Lena Knobloch!&#8221; corrected
Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same thing!&#8221; declared Ned.
&#8220;Knobloch means garlic!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, let&#8217;s get going!&#8221; agreed
Jack.
</p>
<p>The boys lost little time in proceeding to
their hotel, where they went directly to their
room. Here a scene of confusion awaited
them. Their possessions lay scattered around
in disorder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Great Frozen Hot Boxes!&#8221; cried
Jimmie. &#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinder and Norton again, I&#8217;ll bet my
head!&#8221; said Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t satisfied with their first search,&#8221;
agreed Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Came back here and went through everything.
Then I&#8217;ll bet Mackinder grabbed that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
milk cart and dogs, slipped on an old lady&#8217;s
dress and chased down to the dock to see if
he could stop us!&#8221; put in Jack. &#8220;When he
found we were armed he just cut it and ran
away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys, we will do well to pack up and get
aboard that vessel as quickly as possible!&#8221; declared
Ned. &#8220;Through a mistake we&#8217;re under
suspicion, and it won&#8217;t pay us to remain here
another minute!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Replacing their belongings in the bags with
skill and despatch the lads were soon ready.
They at once proceeded to the dock.
</p>
<p>Tramping aboard they proceeded to the
cabin at the after end of the vessel. Entering
they discovered Captain von Kluck seated at
the little table. Before him was a bottle and
a glass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Captain,&#8221; began Ned, &#8220;we&#8217;re here
and ready to go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So-o-o?&#8221; queried von Kluck. &#8220;Vhell, if
you&#8217;re reatty to go, vhy go! But you don&#8217;d go
on dis schip. Vhe don&#8217;d carry bassengers!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A DIFFICULT DEPARTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>Astounded at the statement of the captain,
whom they had begun to regard as a friend
but whose present manner indicated anything
but friendship, the boys glanced at each other
in some degree of alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean by that, Captain?&#8221;
inquired Ned. &#8220;I thought it was understood
that we were to have passage on your boat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhell, den I forgot dot vhe don&#8217;d carry
bassengers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose it took Mackinder to refresh
your memory!&#8221; snapped Jimmie, stepping
forward with an outward thrust of his
chin.
</p>
<p>At the mention of Mackinder&#8217;s name the
captain gave a quick start. His glance at Jimmie
was one of uneasiness and alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vot do you know about Mackinter?&#8221; he
inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know this,&#8221; stated Jimmie, angrily.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a fake and if you know when you&#8217;re
well off you&#8217;ll let go your lines right now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Captain,&#8221; added Ned, &#8220;we found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
Mackinder trying to detain us because he fancies
we have done something wrong or because
he thinks we have something he wants. Who
he may be we don&#8217;t know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know!&#8221; stated the captain, stoutly. &#8220;I
know dot feller is a officer in der British army,
und vhen he says shtay, den I shtay!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An officer in the British army!&#8221; gasped
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I see now why he wants that package!&#8221;
declared Ned. &#8220;He thinks that we are
bringing some instructions or something to
the submarine named &#8216;U-13&#8217; and he&#8217;s trying
to intercept the despatches!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s welcome to the &#8216;U-13&#8217; package
as far as we&#8217;re concerned!&#8221; maintained Jimmie.
&#8220;What we want is to get home to the
little old U. S. A., and that right quick. So,
Captain, we&#8217;ll go now, if you please!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; decided the captain bluntly. &#8220;Vhe
don&#8217;d go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you may listen to reason!&#8221; said Jimmie,
drawing his automatic. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to
hold you up, but you&#8217;re going to get out of
town right now and we&#8217;re going with you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put dot gun oop!&#8221; cried the captain, starting
from his seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will on one condition!&#8221; declared the boy.
&#8220;If you get under way at once without any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
more monkey business I&#8217;ll keep it in my
pocket. If you don&#8217;t I&#8217;ll use it! We are neutral
and we&#8217;re going to remain neutral if we
have to fight to do so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhell, I guess dere&#8217;s no real goot reason
vhy vhe shouldn&#8217;t go, anyhow!&#8221; decided the
captain. &#8220;Mackinter don&#8217;d got no license to
shtop us. Aber he don&#8217;d like id, he couldt
lump id!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking sense!&#8221; declared Jimmie.
&#8220;But, remember! No tricks, or we&#8217;ll
feel like starting something ourselves!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; consented von Kluck, secretly
anxious to help the boys. &#8220;Chust come along
und make me leaf port. Dot let&#8217;s me ouid!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Upon von Kluck&#8217;s appearing at the companionway
the crew immediately assumed an air
of attention. Some were grouped about the
capstan, where they were watching the sky
and speculating on the character of the approaching
storm. Others were occupied at
various duties about the vessel. Every man
seemed to stand in fear of the captain.
</p>
<p>Bawling out a hoarse order, von Kluck at
once assumed command of the deck. Lines
were thrown down from the belaying pins. A
group of men tailed onto the halyards, hoisting
the foresail, staysail and jib.
</p>
<p>The Lena Knobloch was a schooner-rigged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
vessel with two masts. The boys noted with a
considerable degree of satisfaction that she
was built along clipper lines, vastly different
from the round-bowed type of vessel commonly
seen in those waters.
</p>
<p>Under jib, staysail and foresail the vessel
swung around as the dock lines were let go.
Gathering speed with the force of a favorable
wind the little vessel plunged ahead. Von
Kluck was evidently planning on leaving the
harbor without the use of a tug&mdash;a somewhat
difficult, if not dangerous, experiment.
</p>
<p>Urged by the vociferous driving of the mate
men were already hauling on the halyards of
the mainsail. With the added press of sail the
Lena Knobloch heeled over until her lee rail
was nearly awash.
</p>
<p>A strong wind was coming out of the northwest,
favoring the maneuver of von Kluck, but
kicking up considerable commotion on the
harbor. Waves were running so high as to
make navigation of small craft exceedingly
difficult if not dangerous.
</p>
<p>Carrying full staysail, jib, foresail and
mainsail the schooner plunged into the waves,
sending cascades of water over her forecastle
with every leap. She was loaded deeply and
the boys could see that she would prove to be
what the sailors term a &#8220;wet ship.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>Every moment the speed was increasing.
The mate had trimmed the sheets to the exact
point for greatest efficiency.
</p>
<p>Suddenly all hands were startled by a hail
from a point on the starboard bow. They saw
a small motor boat riding dizzily upon the
crest of a wave one moment to be dropped out
of sight in the trough the next.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahoy, the Knobloch!&#8221; came a cry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahoy, the launch!&#8221; bawled out the mate in
a voice of thunder. &#8220;What do you want?
Stand off or we&#8217;ll run you down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We want those passengers of yours!&#8221; was
the reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, come on and get &#8217;em!&#8221; yelled the
mate above the noise of singing wind in the
rigging. &#8220;We can&#8217;t stop now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t heave to I&#8217;ll fire!&#8221; was the
answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night!&#8221; cried Jimmie from a position
near the lee rail, where he could look out beneath
the main boom. &#8220;That&#8217;s Mackinder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A revolver shot sounded amidst the tumult
of rushing waters and singing rigging. The
echo was quickly bitten off by the rising wind.
The shot sounded dully above the humming
and roaring.
</p>
<p>Before Ned could detain him Jimmie fired.
Faintly the boys heard a crash aboard the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
motor boat. The green starboard sidelight of
the launch disappeared. Urged on by the
tremendous press of wind in her sails the
Lena Knobloch was fast dropping the launch
astern.
</p>
<p>No other shots were fired at the schooner.
Scrambling from his position at the starboard
rail Jimmie made his way aft to a point beside
the helmsman. Here he peered eagerly into
the darkness astern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see them at all!&#8221; he announced,
turning presently to his companions, who were
grouped about the little skylight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;ve shaken them off for
keeps!&#8221; ventured Jack. &#8220;Did you see who
that was with Mackinder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;that it was his
pal, Norton!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re safely out of reach now!&#8221;
declared Ned. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it, too! If we
can hold on at this gait we&#8217;ll soon reach a port
in England, where we can transship the Grey
Eagle and get home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only hope the real &#8216;U-13&#8217; doesn&#8217;t come
along and demand that package from us!&#8221;
laughed Harry. &#8220;They might take a notion to
send us to the bottom if we don&#8217;t deliver it
on demand!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hope they&#8217;re busy on the west coast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
of England by this time!&#8221; suggested Jack. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want any more &#8216;U-13&#8217; in mine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhat&#8217;s dot about der &#8216;U-13&#8217;?&#8221; inquired
von Kluck, coming up to the little group. &#8220;Is
id der &#8216;U-13&#8217; dot you&#8217;re skipping?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a few words Ned related the important
details of their experience with the &#8216;U-13&#8217;
package and with Mackinder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; the boy concluded, &#8220;we were just
hoping that the real &#8216;U-13&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t show up
and claim the package that we haven&#8217;t got!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No danger!&#8221; reassured von Kluck. &#8220;Dis
vindt keeps dose fellers under vasser deep!
Dey like rough vedder not at all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; joyfully cried Jimmie. &#8220;Blow,
winds; blow hard!&#8221; the lad continued, stretching
his hands to windward in an appealing
attitude. &#8220;Blow hard enough to keep the submarines
submarooned!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A laugh went round as the boys listened to
Jimmie&#8217;s coined word. They were all heartily
in sympathy with the expressed wish that the
wind would blow hard enough to keep the submarines
from the surface.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, den,&#8221; continued von Kluck, with a
frown that wrinkled his heavy brows, &#8220;dot&#8217;s
not all. Dere&#8217;s mines floatin&#8217; round der Nord
Sea dot dem verdom Deutsches blanted. Maybe
vhe hit one of dem und if vhe do&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>Here the captain shrugged his shoulders,
spreading his hands palm upward and extending
them with a final toss aloft to indicate the
hopelessness of a situation such as he intimated
might befall them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we dodge a mine?&#8221; queried Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, if vhe can see id!&#8221; declared von
Kluck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble,&#8221; explained Ned.
&#8220;These mines float deep and before a ship can
know of its danger&mdash;Bang!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ned,&#8221; announced Jimmie with a
grin, as he wrinkled his freckled nose, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
tell you what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ll bet you my old hat
that if we do hit a mine and get blown up I
go higher than you do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Ned, laughing in spite
of the seriousness of the situation. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
ask von Kluck to be the judge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Von Kluck don&#8217;t seem to be very much
worried over the prospect of hitting a mine!&#8221;
declared Jimmie. &#8220;I guess we&#8217;re all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Und now,&#8221; announced the captain, &#8220;come
to der cabin und eat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys needed no second invitation.
They were soon seated about the little table,
where they found great slabs of cheese set out
on a plate. Loaves of hard, black bread were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
placed upon the table by the steward, who
withdrew to presently reappear bearing a
great pot of steaming coffee. Von Kluck refreshed
himself with a glass of his beloved
&#8220;schnapps,&#8221; then fell to heartily upon the
bread and cheese, motioning to the boys to do
likewise.
</p>
<p>With considerable relish the lads made a
good lunch off the bread and cheese and coffee.
Hard and dark, but possessing considerable
nutriment, the bread was not at all unpleasant
to the taste. It had been plentifully
seasoned with small seeds, which lent an appetizing
flavor.
</p>
<p>Shortly after finishing their lunch the boys
again gained the deck, to find the mate actively
driving the men in their various duties. The
wind still came out of the northwest with a
stinging snap. Ned declared that he could
feel rain approaching.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Feels to me more like snow!&#8221; stated Jimmie,
sniffing to windward. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be getting
outside the Friesian Islands soon and then
we&#8217;ll find out what&#8217;s coming. We&#8217;re somewhat
protected here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will it be before we pass into
the North Sea, Captain von Kluck?&#8221; asked
Ned of the captain, who approached.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhe might make id by morning,&#8221; stated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
the captain. &#8220;I vish I make a swift voyage
dis time. If Mackinter gets news to England
ahead of me, maybe he makes droubles by das
Lena Knobloch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re carrying all the canvas you
dare?&#8221; asked Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chust now, yes! Maybe vhen vhe come
about und head up into der vindt vhe get oop
der tops&#8217;ls und put oop uuder vun chib. I
reach off a goot vays und leaf Amsterdam und
der vest coast of der Zuider Zee, den I make
vun straight reach und run ouid by Eijerlandsche
Gut.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m going below to try for a little
sleep!&#8221; declared Jimmie. &#8220;I&#8217;m not needed on
deck and this wind is too cold for comfort!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you and keep you company,&#8221;
volunteered Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all go,&#8221; added Harry. &#8220;Come on,
Ned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clinging to hand rails the lads scrambled
below. The deck leaned at an angle that made
walking almost impossible. Every plunge
sent shivers through the little vessel. Tons
of water broke over the bows and dashed along
the planks to rush hissing through the scuppers.
</p>
<p>In the cabin a lamp swung wildly from a
beam overhead, throwing weird, dancing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
shadows on the bulkheads. Here the noises
of the wind were hushed. Only a moaning
from the taut rigging reached the ears of the
four lads. But the cabin was full of eerie
sounds of creaking timbers and straining
planks. For some time the boys lay on lockers
listening to the confusion of noises.
Presently they fell asleep.
</p>
<p>They were wakened by the sound of tramping
feet on deck, and knew that some
maneuver was about to be executed. Coils of
rigging were flung on deck. The stentorian
voice of the mate bawled out orders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand by to come about!&#8221; roared you
Kluck over their heads.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A WARNING FROM THE SEA</h3>
</div>

<p>Springing from their resting places the four
boys staggered up the unsteady companionway.
As they gained the deck they were assailed
by terrific gusts of wind carrying sleet
and snow. During their stay below the
weather had turned colder, bringing fitful
dashes of sleet out of the north. The schooner
presently rode easier.
</p>
<p>A hoarse order from forward was followed
by a clanking of the cable through the hawse
pipes. The sails rattled with great slapping
noises as the Lena Knobloch rode to her
anchor.
</p>
<p>Men were instantly aloft securing the
lighter topsails. With a run the foresail and
mainsail were lowered and furled. The staysail
and jib had but a moment before been
lowered as the schooner was headed into the
wind. Under bare poles they rode on gentler
swells.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we?&#8221; asked Harry, throwing
up an arm to protect his face. &#8220;Have we
reached England yet? Where is the captain?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Vhell, how do you like id now?&#8221; roared
the voice of von Kluck almost at Harry&#8217;s
elbow. &#8220;Vhat you tink of dis for some
shtorm?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is fierce!&#8221; replied the lad, bracing
himself against the wind. &#8220;Where are we
now, Captain von Kluck?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Under der lee of one of der Friesian
Islands,&#8221; replied the captain. &#8220;I see some
rocks aheadt und dere is a big shteamer in
drouble oop to vindvard. I hope she makes id
into safety, bud I don&#8217;d know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Shaking his head doubtfully the captain
went away forward. Presently he returned,
still shaking his head. The crew except the
captain and the mate were gathered forward
round the capstan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dere&#8217;s rocks dere&mdash;lots of dem!&#8221; announced
von Kluck. &#8220;Dot wessel looks like
she&#8217;s lost her rutter, und if she gets off dem
rocks dot captain needs a medal. I tink he&#8217;s a
goner, sure!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It did, indeed, appear as if von Kluck was
right. A big cargo steamer, now dimly discernible
to the boys, was rolling in the trough
of a heavy sea, urged on by a vicious wind
from the northwest. Her range lights showed
clearly at the mast heads. A gleam of red
indicated that the vessel was showing her port
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
side. With every roll great masses of water
boarded the weather rail, sweeping the decks
of every movable object.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried the mate, excitedly pointing
toward the steamer.
</p>
<p>There was no need of explanation. A great
mass of rock directly in the path upon which
the steamer was drifting sent gigantic columns
of water into the air with every wave.
Although the eastern sky showed a tinge of
gray the blackness upon the water was intense.
It was lightened momentarily by the
white smother of spray and foam cast upward
as wave after wave broke upon the black and
threatening menace lying immediately before
the apparently doomed vessel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Py golly, he&#8217;s all right!&#8221; yelled von Kluck
in a moment. &#8220;He&#8217;s lost dot rutter und he&#8217;s
backing on his enchines! He&#8217;ll make id!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Surely enough the steamer&#8217;s captain was
executing the very maneuver at which von
Kluck had guessed. By backing on his engines
he succeeded in drawing the vessel so
far to one side of the dangerous rock that it
was passed. Only a margin extremely narrow
intervened.
</p>
<p>But the danger had not passed. Another
rock threatened to tear to pieces the all but
helpless vessel. With straining eyes and beating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
hearts the lads watched anxiously as this
danger was also cleared.
</p>
<p>They clung to the weather shrouds in spite
of the whip-like sting of sleet and spray,
watching the struggle against wind, wave and
rock.
</p>
<p>At length the vessel won through the dangerous
places. It was now so close that the
boys could make out the details of the rigging.
Ned procured a pair of binoculars and spelled
out the name.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That steamer is the Anne of Melbourne,&#8221;
he announced. &#8220;I wonder if it isn&#8217;t an Australian
vessel. They have had a hard time
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s close to us now,&#8221; cried Harry. &#8220;I
wonder what they&#8217;ll do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re wise they&#8217;ll let go an anchor and
ride it out,&#8221; answered Jimmie. &#8220;If I had
sense enough to bring a vessel through a tight
place like that I&#8217;d get a hook overboard as
soon as I could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what they are doing!&#8221; announced
Ned. &#8220;There&#8217;s a group of men at
the forward end preparing to get the anchor
over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Directly the boys heard the rattle of the
cable in the steamer&#8217;s hawse pipes, followed
instantly by a great splash at the bow that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
told as plainly as words that the ground tackle
was out.
</p>
<p>Still feeling the heave of waves surging
around the head of the island the steamer
slowly swung to her cable. The range lights
shifted their position. The red side light disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s safe now!&#8221; cried Ned, in a tone of
relief. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad they made it all right. I
wonder how they got crippled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me take the glasses a minute, Ned,&#8221;
requested Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you see what&#8217;s the matter with her?&#8221;
queried Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the boy, with the glasses to
his eye. &#8220;Von Kluck was right. It looks as
if the rudder stock is twisted and bent badly
out of shape. As the stern lifts I can see the
blades of the propeller all right, but the rudder
seems to be missing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Anne of Melbourne,&#8221; mused Ned. &#8220;I
wonder now what that vessel is doing away
off up here. If they had a cargo destined for
an English port they should have been much
farther south.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose the captain lost his
reckoning and got this far out of his course,
do you?&#8221; suggested Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Ned. Then turning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
to Captain von Kluck the lad continued:
&#8220;Captain, what do you think about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mit der var doing so many tings, I don&#8217;d
know what to tink!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see men moving about on deck now,
apparently clearing up the recent damage,&#8221;
stated Harry. &#8220;And I see a Boy Scout, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; objected Jimmie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say that!
I don&#8217;t want any more Boy Scouts mixed up
in this! It isn&#8217;t fair!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, he&#8217;s there!&#8221; laughed Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; stated Jimmie, with a sigh
of resignation, &#8220;we are in for another siege
of it. I never knew it to fail! Just as quickly
as we get going somewhere and a Boy Scout
shows up there&#8217;s trouble ahead and lots of it!
Why can&#8217;t they stay home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Jimmie,&#8221; cautioned Ned, &#8220;you know
we&#8217;ve never in all our adventures found a Boy
Scout that really brought us ill luck. Sometimes
they&#8217;ve caused us a lot of trouble, but
usually they help!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, too, but I wish we could get
home to the little old U. S. A. without mixing
up in this &#8216;U-13&#8217; business with the Boy
Scouts!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;ll come out all right after all,&#8221;
soothed Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; reluctantly agreed Jimmie. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
say, Harry,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;let me take those
glasses. I want to see what that fellow&#8217;s
like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Long and eagerly the lad peered through
the binoculars.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see him!&#8221; he cried, presently. &#8220;He&#8217;s going
up the foreshrouds! I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s working
his passage on that steamer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doing on the foreshrouds?&#8221;
asked Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if something had fouled at the
fore top,&#8221; replied Jimmie. &#8220;He&#8217;s going up
to clear it, I guess. Oh, look!&#8221; the boy
shouted. &#8220;He&#8217;s falling! He&#8217;s broken one of
the ratlines and is falling!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see him!&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;I can see him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, good!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmie, the next
moment. &#8220;He hit the shrouds and the steamer
rolled at the right minute, throwing him clear
of the deck. See that splash in the water?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it!&#8221; answered the others, together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they trying to help him?&#8221; asked
Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are,&#8221; stated Jimmie. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
thrown him a ring buoy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you see him now?&#8221; asked Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and he&#8217;s swimming. There must be a
current in here that&#8217;s dragging him away from
the steamer. The buoy fell short and he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
swimming directly away from the steamer.
He&#8217;s coming towards us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Intently the lad watched the one in the
water. He swam a good stroke resting easily,
even though somewhat impeded by his clothing.
</p>
<p>Now and again as the crest of a wave approached
the swimmer his head was submerged,
only to reappear again in the yeasty
froth following the racing monster. Eagerly
his progress was noted by all on board the
schooner. They were at a loss to understand
why he had left his own vessel to swim toward
a strange craft.
</p>
<p>Presently, however, as he approached the
Lena Knobloch the lad&#8217;s strokes became more
feeble. He was evidently tiring rapidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, what do you say to getting a boat
over?&#8221; asked Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhait!&#8221; grunted von Kluck. &#8220;Id&#8217;s lots of
vork to do id!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the lad may need help!&#8221; urged Ned,
eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhell, if he needs id, I put him ofer. Nod
before!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jimmie ran forward into the very eyes of
the schooner. In his hands he grasped a ring
buoy, to which was attached a goodly length
of line. This he coiled ready to heave the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
buoy to the one in the water as soon as he
should come within reach.
</p>
<p>Just as Jimmie was measuring with his eye
the distance separating the swimmer from his
goal and preparing for a mighty throw of the
buoy he noted that the other&#8217;s stroke was fast
weakening.
</p>
<p>With a jerk the Wolf unfastened and kicked
loose a shoe. In an instant the other followed.
A rapid movement loosened his jacket. A
backward twist of his shoulders helped him
slip from the garment.
</p>
<p>One look over the rail showed that the swimmer
was losing control of his muscles. Both
hands went up into the air only to disappear
beneath the crest of an oncoming wave. The
boy stayed under.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand by to get me, boys!&#8221; shouted Jimmie.
</p>
<p>A splash told that he had gone overboard.
His companions crowded eagerly to the rail,
watching for his reappearance. In a moment
they were relieved to see his red head come up
close to the spot where the other had sunk.
Emptying his lungs of the pent up air with a
loud &#8220;Whoosh!&#8221; the boy instantly refilled
them to plunge again under water.
</p>
<p>To the intense satisfaction of those on board
the schooner he again came quickly to the surface,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
this time dragging by the hair the boy
to whose rescue he had gone. Swimming on
his back, using but one hand, Jimmie slowly
brought the other lad to a position where he
could reach the buoy flung to him by Ned&#8217;s
strong arm.
</p>
<p>Harry had already made a bowline in a bight
at the end of a line. This he passed over the
side to Jimmie, who succeeded without difficulty
in getting the loop over the shoulders of
the rescued lad.
</p>
<p>Soon both were on deck, where they received
the attentions of all hands. Captain
von Kluck insisted upon giving the newcomer
a draught of &#8220;schnapps&#8221; to assist in the reviving
process. As the fiery liquor burned its
way down his throat the lad coughed violently.
</p>
<p>Choking and spitting the lad clawed at his
burning mouth and throat. Evidently he
thought the cure worse than the disease.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get into the cabin,&#8221; suggested Jimmie.
&#8220;I&#8217;m freezing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough!&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;How thoughtless
of us! Captain,&#8221; he added, &#8220;can you have
the steward bring us some coffee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roaring for the steward to perform this
service, the captain picked up the nearly
drowned lad in his strong arms. He deposited
the boy on a locker in the cabin, then stood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
aside to permit his passengers to administer
such assistance as they might.
</p>
<p>Ned stepped forward to begin operations.
With a cry he bent over the boy. Wonderingly
the others crowded forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank!&#8221; cried Ned, seizing the lad by the
shoulders. &#8220;Frank! Speak to me! Frank,
how did you get here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; asked Jimmie, elbowing his
way into the group to a position where he
could see the recumbent figure. &#8220;Why,&#8221; continued
the boy in a tone of amazement, &#8220;if it
ain&#8217;t old Frank Shaw of New York!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A cup of steaming coffee at this moment
brought by the steward was offered to the
newcomer, who drank eagerly. He glanced
about the group with a faint smile in answer
to their puzzled looks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out for the &#8216;U-13&#8217;, boys!&#8221; he said.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>MORE ABOUT THE &#8220;U-13&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Frank Shaw!&#8221; cried Jimmie, crowding
close to the lad lying on the locker. &#8220;What&#8217;s
that you&#8217;re saying about the &#8216;U-13&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say &#8216;Look out for it,&#8217; that&#8217;s all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t all!&#8221; protested the boy. &#8220;Take
another drink of this coffee and then brace
up and tell us what you know! How did you
get here and what and who and where and
why is this &#8216;U-13&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Frank smiled as he struggled to a sitting
posture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll rub the cramp out of that leg,
boys, I&#8217;ll &#8216;fess up&#8217; everything,&#8221; he began.
&#8220;That leg feels as if some one were trying to
pull some teeth out of it by the roots. A
cramp is fierce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two lads began massaging the offending
member.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d known it was you swimming to us,
I&#8217;d have lowered a boat myself and come to
your assistance!&#8221; declared Jimmie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And if I&#8217;d known you were on board this
schooner,&#8221; replied Frank, &#8220;I&#8217;d have left that
ship long before I did!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter on that ship,
Frank?&#8221; asked Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing, only it&#8217;s one of these &#8216;work-houses&#8217;
just exactly like we have read of.
The captain is a hard nut and the mates are
both of the &#8216;bucko&#8217; type. There isn&#8217;t a man
aboard who hasn&#8217;t got a mark from one or
the other of the mates. They&#8217;re a tough
crowd!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you didn&#8217;t just fall overboard,
then!&#8221; shrewdly guessed Jimmie. &#8220;You
missed your footing purposely! You know
you did!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; grinned Frank, nursing
his cramped leg.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was watching through the binoculars,&#8221;
answered Jimmie. &#8220;But go ahead and tell us
something. We&#8217;re dying from curiosity!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began Frank, &#8220;you know I wasn&#8217;t
quite satisfied to be left behind when you four
lads left in chase of the fellow who had stolen
the Panama plans. I wanted to go along in
the Grey Eagle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that, and we&#8217;re sorry we didn&#8217;t
take you!&#8221; cried Ned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I went to see Mr. Bosworth about following
you,&#8221; continued young Shaw. &#8220;He was
opposed to that plan, but you know I usually
get my own way somehow. I put together a
kit and started out. I had little difficulty in
securing passage on a ship loaded with miscellaneous
cargo for England. The vessel was
a British tramp&mdash;a &#8216;bucko&#8217; ship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We got close to Land&#8217;s End after a rather
uneventful voyage across the Atlantic. I was
dreaming of getting ashore in a short time
and then hiking across the channel into France
to hunt you up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One fine morning we were all startled to
hear a hail from the lookout informing the
deck that a submarine was approaching. We
hove to at the command of the submarine people.
They commanded our captain to get his
crew into the boats as quickly as possible, for
in five minutes they intended torpedoing the
ship. They wouldn&#8217;t take &#8216;No&#8217; for an answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was going some, I must say!&#8221; put in
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be told, of course,&#8221; went on
Frank, &#8220;that we lost little time making preparations.
One of the sailors disputed my right
to take my kit into the small boat. I objected
and he cracked me on the jaw. When I recovered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
I was alone on the vessel. The boats
were at some little distance away, with the
crew pulling like racers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For a moment I was quite desperate, not
knowing how to escape. I thought of trying
to signal the submarine, but could see the vessel
just launching a torpedo. Seemingly the
whole after end of the ship was shattered by
the explosion. As soon as I could I tried to
signal the enemy, but they were just turning
about to leave the spot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I didn&#8217;t hustle about some. The
ship was already filling rapidly. The stern
was settling fast. All the boats were gone. I
could see nothing to serve as a float. Desperately
I seized a capstan bar and knocked
the wedges and battens off a hatch cover.
Then I got a small piece of line. I passed it
through a ring bolt and made fast. I figured
that when the ship went down the cover would
float free for a raft on which I could keep up.
Before I was fully ready the compressed air
blew the cover off with a &#8216;boom&#8217;. It landed
close to the rail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as the hull took a last slant I jumped
overboard. After swimming quite a distance
away I saw the ship go down. I turned back.
There was my hatch cover floating just as I
expected.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>Here Frank paused to extend his hand for
another cup of coffee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the wise little Scout!&#8221; declared
Jimmie, admiringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; agreed Frank. &#8220;Then,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;I floated around for the rest of the
day on that hatch cover. Toward evening I
saw a smoke off to the southwest. It was just
out of the glare of the sun. When it got
nearer I knew it was a steamer bound for
England or some nearby place. It was the
Anne of Melbourne. So here I am!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about this &#8216;U-13&#8217;?&#8221; inquired
Harry, eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I nearly forgot,&#8221; said Frank.
&#8220;The submarine that torpedoed the ship was
marked &#8216;U-13&#8217; on the side!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve been doing a lot of that, according
to the newspapers!&#8221; stated Ned. &#8220;But
why do you warn us to look out for her?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I told the captain of the Anne of
my experience,&#8221; went on Frank, &#8220;he decided
to head north, intending to go to the westward
of Ireland, around between Scotland and the
Shetland Island into the North Sea, in the
hopes of dodging the submarine, which seemed
to be working the waters of the English Channel.
Yesterday morning we were hailed by a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
submarine. I could see that it was the same
old &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it get way up here?&#8221; questioned
Ned, incredulously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me!&#8221; replied Frank. &#8220;They ordered
us to heave to, but that captain is a daredevil.
He cracked on all steam full speed
ahead, declaring that if they took him they&#8217;d
have to catch him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The submarine launched a torpedo at us,
but it only smashed our rudder. We had good
headway on. That, of course, put us in a
mighty bad fix, as the submarine could then
have easily sent a torpedo into us, but for some
unknown reason they turned and left us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The captain was nearly crazy when he discovered
what damage had been done. The
vessel had been bad enough before, but it became
ten times worse. I got a crack or two
with a rope&#8217;s end that sting yet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could they navigate?&#8221; asked Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t!&#8221; answered Frank. &#8220;We
just lay in the trough of the seas and let the
old tub roll. They even put preventer stays
on the masts and on the boilers to keep them
from rolling out of the crazy old wagon. You
never saw such a place as that ship was!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then when the captain got her under
the lee of this land and you saw this schooner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
you just concluded that you&#8217;d jump the
ship?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; agreed Frank. &#8220;I had lost my
kit when the sailing vessel went down, so I
left nothing on the steamer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awful glad you got here safely,&#8221; stated
Ned, grasping Frank&#8217;s hand in a hearty clasp
that spoke eloquently of the friendship between
the two boys. &#8220;But you&#8217;re too late to
help capture the Panama Canal plan thief.
He&#8217;s out of his misery quite a while ago!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s just in time to get mixed up in
this &#8216;U-13&#8217; business!&#8221; urged Jimmie. &#8220;He&#8217;s
right in the midst of the excitement!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But since you don&#8217;t want any more Boy
Scouts along we&#8217;ll pitch Frank overboard
again!&#8221; declared Harry, with mock gravity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, you go on!&#8221; scorned Jimmie. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know it was Frank!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laughing at Jimmie&#8217;s confusion the boys
related to their chum the salient points of
their experience up to the time of their
strange meeting. Frank was greatly puzzled
over the circumstances of the strange package,
for the presence of which in their kits the boys
could not account.
</p>
<p>For some time the lads remained in the
cabin, drying the uniforms of the swimmers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
and exchanging experiences. It was the
opinion of all that they would be adopting a
wise course to return at once to New York.
</p>
<p>Captain von Kluck was greatly interested
in his strange passengers. He listened eagerly
to Frank&#8217;s account of the doings of the strange
submarine. At the conclusion of the recital
he paced the deck nervously.
</p>
<p>Not until midafternoon did the wind decrease
sufficiently to permit the Lena Knobloch
to venture forth from her position of
shelter.
</p>
<p>Through the binoculars the boys made long
examinations of the steamer lying to windward
of their position. They determined that
preparations were being made to send a boat&#8217;s
crew to some port for assistance in towing the
crippled vessel to a harbor.
</p>
<p>At one bell, or half past four o&#8217;clock, Captain
von Kluck came from his cabin. He
stepped to the rail, sniffing at the wind. Presently
he turned to join the mate in his walk
across the deck.
</p>
<p>For some minutes the two conversed in low
tones. Directly the mate stepped forward,
bawling out orders to his men.
</p>
<p>At once all was commotion on the Knobloch&#8217;s
decks. Men tumbled eagerly about,
hauling a line here, letting go another there,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
until they had set the double reefed mainsail,
foresail and a mere rag of jib.
</p>
<p>When this had been accomplished all hands
seized capstan bars. To the tune of a Dutch
sailors&#8217; &#8220;chanty&#8221; the links of the cable slowly
clanked inboard. With a lurch the Lena
Knobloch swung as the anchor broke ground.
Like a storm driven bird she was off in the
wings of a northwester, lying far over even
under the greatly reduced sail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to now, Captain?&#8221; asked Ned as
von Kluck stepped along the deck with head
bent forward. By his manner of nervous intentness
Ned guessed that the captain was
carrying a load on his mind.
</p>
<p>Von Kluck&#8217;s only response was a growl as
he passed the boys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain&#8217;s grouchy!&#8221; declared Jimmie.
&#8220;Leave him alone, Ned!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, don&#8217;t bother him!&#8221; added Frank.
&#8220;He&#8217;s worried enough!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, I don&#8217;t like his looks!&#8221;
stated Ned with some degree of apprehension.
&#8220;He seems to have soured after hearing about
the &#8216;U-13.&#8217; Didn&#8217;t you fellows notice how he
listened to Frank&#8217;s story?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure we did,&#8221; Jimmie replied, &#8220;but then,
it&#8217;s only natural that he should be worried
over the possibility of losing his vessel!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, his getting under way in this
weather shows that he intends to be square
and land us in an English port as he agreed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess von Kluck is a pretty good sort of
a chap, after all!&#8221; ventured Harry. &#8220;He has
tried to treat us as right as he could!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re right. We can&#8217;t blame him
for feeling somewhat worried under the circumstances.
We&#8217;d be grouchy, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Under a port helm the Lena Knobloch
swung to starboard leaping forward into the
waves as if glad to again be battling with the
sea.
</p>
<p>Ned and his companions felt that they could
be of no service in handling the schooner.
They, therefore, retired to the shelter of the
cabin, where they were protected from the
stinging blasts of sleet and snow that came
screaming out of the northwest.
</p>
<p>Scarcely had the schooner won clear of the
jagged ledges when the full force of the tumbling
waves was felt. It seemed to the boys
that the stern of the little vessel was hurled
to an unbelievable height only to drop so far
they feared nothing could save them.
</p>
<p>But Captain von Kluck and his mate were
expert navigators. They had sailed the ocean
since large enough to handle a line. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
knew the Lena Knobloch&#8217;s ability to withstand
the buffeting of the elements.
</p>
<p>As night drew on the boys expected to witness
a cessation of the storm. Their prediction
was fulfilled. Gradually the gale blew
itself out, leaving but a strong sailing breeze,
although the water still continued rough.
Captain von Kluck took advantage of this
change to shake out the reefs in his canvas
and to spread more sail.
</p>
<p>Just as the moon showed in the east between
masses of cloud the lookout reported a
ship in sight off the port bow. In a short time
the two vessels had approached within about
two miles of each other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re apparently heaving to!&#8221; cried
Ned who had been using the binoculars. &#8220;It
looks as if they&#8217;re getting the boats over!&#8221;
</p>
<p>From the waist of the other vessel the boys
saw a great cloud of dark smoke appear. The
small boats had scarcely gone a ship&#8217;s length
away from the scene. The crew were rowing
with the greatest haste.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the conning tower of a submarine!&#8221;
cried Ned.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE VISIT</h3>
</div>

<p>Clearly visible to the members of the crew
on the Lena Knobloch the great cloud of
smoke slowly spread over the vessel.
</p>
<p>Directly a sullen &#8220;Boom&#8221; reached their
ears. As the smoke spread away the lads
could see a great rent in the side through
which water was rushing. Already the ship
was listing heavily.
</p>
<p>Two small boats were being pulled away
from the vicinity by the crew of the doomed
vessel. The small craft were handled in a
seamanlike manner. They made good progress
in spite of the still heavy sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By golly!&#8221; ejaculated Von Kluck, drawing
a long breath. &#8220;Maybe vhe get id next,
vhat? Dere ain&#8217;d no vay of tellin&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think that, Captain?&#8221; questioned
Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dot verdom &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221; grunted Von Kluck.
&#8220;Vhe&#8217;ll pe lucky,&#8221;&mdash;here his excitement
grew so intense that he delivered himself of
several great sailor&#8217;s oaths&mdash;&#8220;if vhe make a
port in England alretty!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Keep a sharp lookout, boys,&#8221; said Ned.
&#8220;Maybe we can get a sight of the &#8216;U-13&#8217; if it&#8217;s
still in this neighborhood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Scarcely had the boy uttered the words before
the lookout hailed the deck. His voice
vibrated with excitement and fear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vot is, aloft, dere?&#8221; roared Von Kluck.
</p>
<p>Excitedly jabbering in his intense emotion
the lookout frantically pointed in the direction
of the sinking ship. Without waiting for
orders he came sliding down the halliards.
As he landed on deck he turned an ashen face
toward the captain. Again he pointed seaward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221; he gasped in an agony of
terror.
</p>
<p>A glance in the direction indicated showed
the boys an object like a spar buoy apparently
standing upright in the water. The next
moment a swell rolled over something beneath
the upright object.
</p>
<p>The next wave disclosed a long, rounded
steel hull. In the center the conning tower
showed plainly. A moment later the outlines
of the dreaded submarine were distinguishable
as the craft was propelled to the surface.
Each wave broke clear over the arched back
of this terror of the seas leaving the black hull
gleaming in the faint light. Only the upper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
portion of the conning tower escaped a ducking.
</p>
<p>Presently the hatch was opened. A man in
uniform stepped out onto the narrow confines
of the small deck. His attention was directed
toward the schooner. After what seemed to
the boys to be an almost endless examination
of their vessel the man turned to address a
remark to some one evidently close to the
hatch but out of their vision.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is he saying?&#8221; Ned asked von
Kluck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He iss telling dot odder feller dot vhe iss
das Lena Knobloch!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What next, I wonder?&#8221; speculated Jimmie
aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next?&#8221; almost screamed von Kluck.
&#8220;Next, vhe iss ordered to get by our boats
into und row far enough avhay so dey couldt
blow up us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In his intense agitation the captain began
pacing up and down the deck. The submarine
drew close alongside the schooner easily
keeping pace with the sailing vessel at the
rate they were progressing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Von Kluck is certainly worked up about
it,&#8221; remarked Harry as he noted the captain&#8217;s
distracted manner. &#8220;He&#8217;s almost bughouse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so would you be, too, if all you had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
were about to be sent to the bottom of the
ocean!&#8221; declared Ned. &#8220;It&#8217;s tough luck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;d better be getting our kits in
shape,&#8221; suggested Jack moving toward the
cabin. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to leave everything!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to leave everything,&#8221; put in Frank,
&#8220;when they sunk the ship I was on. I felt
lucky to get away with my life!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make a try for it, anyway,&#8221; continued
Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; cried Ned, &#8220;let&#8217;s see
what they&#8217;re going to do. The man is going
below again! Why don&#8217;t he hail us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Strangely enough the officer was descending
the hatchway without speaking a word to
those on board the schooner.
</p>
<p>This procedure puzzled von Kluck, but did
not serve to reduce in any degree the excitement
under which he was laboring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay aft a couble of handts und make reaty
der boats!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Come on, hurry
oop! Lifely, now, men!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In obedience to this command two members
of the crew sprang towards the stern of the
schooner to make preparations for launching
the boat lashed at the stern. Two others
frantically loosened the lashings of the upturned
boat lying amidships.
</p>
<p>A clanking sound indicating that the hatchway
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
of the &#8220;U-13&#8221; had been closed attracted
the attention of the boys in that direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they going to do now?&#8221; questioned
Jimmie eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy they are going to pull away a little
so as to launch a torpedo at us,&#8221; stated Ned.
&#8220;It don&#8217;t look as if they&#8217;re going to be kind
enough to let us get off the vessel before they
blow it up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it isn&#8217;t the same crew I met!&#8221; declared
Frank firmly. &#8220;They treated the men
fine! While I must admit that I don&#8217;t admire
their way of sinking merchant ships, I will
have to say that they gave the people a chance
to get out of danger!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, is it the same submarine you saw?&#8221;
asked Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks exactly like it. Besides,&#8221; the
boy continued, &#8220;I see the figures &#8216;U-13&#8217;
painted on the side of this one, too. I believe
it is the very same vessel. Maybe they won&#8217;t
sink us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With hatch closed the submarine was preparing
to execute some maneuver. Gathering
speed the craft plunged ahead quickly
leaving the schooner alone. Scarcely had the
bow of the sailing vessel been passed ere the
submarine was so far beneath the water as to
show only the periscope. In a moment there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
was but a swirl to indicate where that had
been. Presently it, too, disappeared. The
&#8220;U-13&#8221; was gone.
</p>
<p>For some time the boys stood at the rail
eagerly scanning the water to discover evidence
of the submarine&#8217;s return. Their
search was fruitless. Nothing was found to
indicate the presence of their late visitor.
The waves rose and fell without hint of its
location.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Captain von Kluck!&#8221; Ned called.
&#8220;They have gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhat?&#8221; asked the captain in a tone expressing
doubt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; continued the boy. &#8220;They have
slipped back into the ocean again and have
left us. Possibly they think we&#8217;re too small
for them to waste a torpedo on. Torpedoes
cost a lot of money, you know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhell, dot&#8217;s lucky!&#8221; answered the captain,
much relieved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure is!&#8221; assented Jimmie, throwing out
his chest. &#8220;You see, Captain, we&#8217;re mascots
for you. We&#8217;ve brought you good luck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joining in the laugh that greeted this remark
the captain ordered the men who had
been at work upon the boats to cease their
operations. A hand was again posted aloft to
act as lookout.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>After a short consultation between von
Kluck and the mate it was decided to proceed
on the course traveled by the steamer from
which Frank Shaw had recently escaped.
They intended to pass between the Shetland
islands and the coast of Scotland in an attempt
to make a port on the west side of
England, believing that there would be less
danger in this procedure. Accordingly all
sail possible was made.
</p>
<p>As if understanding the necessity for haste
the vessel leaned far over under the press of
canvas and sprang forward with increased
speed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to make the west coast of England
in a short time, Captain, at this rate,&#8221;
said Ned as he noted with satisfaction the rate
at which the Lena Knobloch was traveling
through the water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;d know!&#8221; declared von Kluck.
&#8220;Dere&#8217;s nasty vedder oop dere!&#8221; he added,
pointing to the western sky. &#8220;I don&#8217;d like
id!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t very well blow hard enough to
stop us, can it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;d you tink it can&#8217;t blow hard in dese
vatters! Ask me&mdash;I know!&#8221; replied the captain
sagely wagging his head.
</p>
<p>With eager looks the boys watched the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
gathering clouds to westward. The captain&#8217;s
prediction seemed about to be verified.
</p>
<p>An uncommonly strong puff of wind struck
the schooner heeling her far over to starboard.
The blast bore a chill as of ice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, boys,&#8221; cried Jimmie turning his head
away from the biting blast, &#8220;look up to windward
and see how smooth the ocean is getting!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s wind coming!&#8221; shouted Ned.
</p>
<p>An order was roared out by von Kluck.
Men sprang to the lines. The sails were
stowed with a speed that seemed scarcely credible.
Heeling round on a port helm the Lena
Knobloch turned from the approaching blast.
</p>
<p>Leaving only the shortened jib von Kluck
and the mate stood on the after deck peering
anxiously at the violent disturbance overtaking
the little vessel. Now and again the mate
glanced apprehensively at the schooner&#8217;s
masts or along the decks.
</p>
<p>With a shriek the storm struck. For a
moment the very weight of wind seemed to
settle the schooner farther into the water.
The next instant they were tearing along with
the speed of a race horse.
</p>
<p>Flattened by the pressure of the wind the
waves no longer gave her motion. By reason
of her being headed directly away from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
blast the schooner rode on an even keel.
Every line, every shroud hummed like the
strings of a gigantic harp. The noise was
terrific.
</p>
<p>A glance at the compass in the binnacle
showed Ned that they were headed nearly
northeast. They were fast leaving England
astern.
</p>
<p>Conversation was almost impossible in the
howling gale that tore and fretted at the vessel.
Yet Ned managed to shout to the captain:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much sea room have we got in this
direction?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A shrug of the shoulders indicated the captain&#8217;s
doubt. He accompanied this movement
with a wagging of the head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhe&#8217;ll get into der lee of somedings bretty
soon,&#8221; he replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I surely hope so!&#8221; declared Ned, cupping
his hands to carry his voice to the other&#8217;s ear.
&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to hit anything at this rate!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nodding an acknowledgment to this assertion
the captain by signs indicated to the mate
that he desired a hand sent aloft as lookout.
</p>
<p>In a short time it seemed to the boys that the
terrific force of the gale had somewhat spent
itself. Waves began to toss the vessel at an
alarming rate. Each mountain of water appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
about to board the schooner at the
stern, threatening to crush the craft by its
weight.
</p>
<p>Anxious for the safety of the vessel and for
their own welfare the lads, nevertheless, understood
that they could do little good on deck.
They, therefore, made their way into the cabin,
where they sat on lockers.
</p>
<p>Here the noises of the tempest were somewhat
stilled, but the creaking and groaning of
the timbers was far more noticeable. It
seemed to the lads that the vessel was being
torn asunder by every billow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what weather the old &#8216;U-13&#8217; is
making of it about now?&#8221; said Frank, as the
boys grouped themselves about the little table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in smoother water than this, I&#8217;ll venture
to say,&#8221; put in Jimmie, clutching the edge
of the table in an effort to support himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are not in better water than this,&#8221;
remarked Harry, &#8220;they&#8217;re getting shaken up
some! I&#8217;d like to be under water right now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Harry,&#8221; spoke up Ned, &#8220;you
shouldn&#8217;t say that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean in a tight little submarine!&#8221; explained
Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we had the Sea Lion over here!&#8221;
cried Jimmie. &#8220;We could have more fun than
we had when we tried to rescue the papers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
out of that ship in the Gulf of Tong King with
Moore and his nosey son butting in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was sure some fine boat!&#8221; declared
Ned. &#8220;Just as easy to ride in as a rocking
chair. And it was always smooth and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s speech was cut short by a violent
roll of the vessel. All the lads were thrown
in a heap to the cabin floor. Directly the
schooner righted herself, but began pitching
with a violent motion. From the sounds the
boys knew that the captain had hove to, bringing
the vessel into the wind. Apparently he
intended riding out the storm.
</p>
<p>Waves were breaking over the bows, falling
with tremendous blows upon the forward deck.
The scuppers were not able to release the
flood.
</p>
<p>Suddenly a terrific crash sounded directly
beneath the cabin floor. The stern seemed to
lift bodily into the air. A shudder ran through
the fabric. Again the boys fell to the deck.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>SHIPWRECK AND RESCUE</h3>
</div>

<p>Above the noises of the tempest and the
straining timbers sounded cries from the deck
that told of confusion amongst the crew. Von
Kluck&#8217;s hoarse voice was bawling out orders
mixed with great sea oaths. He was driving
the men to some duty.
</p>
<p>The tramping of feet above the boys sounded
for a moment, then ceased. Judging from the
sounds they thought the men had gathered in
the waist of the vessel. Puzzled, they looked
at each other in fear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; inquired Jimmie, attempting
to rise to his feet.
</p>
<p>Ned steadied himself at the table as he tried
to peer out of the little skylight overhead. He
could see nothing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We just about struck something!&#8221; declared
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we hit another vessel,&#8221; ventured
Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or a rock, perhaps,&#8221; continued Jack. &#8220;We
surely struck something solid. I hope we
don&#8217;t hit it again like that first crack!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, boys!&#8221; cried Ned in alarm.
&#8220;The motion of this ship is much less than it
was a minute ago! Notice it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It surely is!&#8221; agreed Jack. &#8220;Is the wind
going down?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are getting into some sort of shelter,&#8221;
guessed Harry. &#8220;Probably von Kluck has
navigated the schooner behind a breakwater.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys, the ship is sinking!&#8221; shouted Ned.
&#8220;See the water coming into this cabin! We&#8217;ve
struck a floating mine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In alarm the boys sprang to their feet. As
Ned had said, the motion was lessening
rapidly. They found little difficulty now in
keeping their footing without support. With
one accord they made a break for the companionway,
crowding out in a body.
</p>
<p>The sight that met their gaze brought consternation
to every heart. The schooner lay
head to the wind. The mainsail had been set
with a double reef, to help keep the vessel in
that position. The seas seemed alarmingly
higher than when they had been last on deck.
</p>
<p>This was due, of course, to the difference in
perspective, owing to the fact that they were
fast settling into the water.
</p>
<p>Above the stern clung traces of heavy, black
smoke. A disagreeable odor pervaded the
atmosphere in spite of the strong wind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There goes von Kluck and the crew!&#8221;
shouted Harry, pointing to leeward. &#8220;They&#8217;re
scared to death. That mine settled them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A short distance away the boys could see
the larger of the two boats that had been carried
by the schooner. In it were the members
of the crew, accompanied by the captain and
the mate.
</p>
<p>Tossed about by the angry waters the little
shell seemed about to be engulfed at any moment.
However, skillful hands were at the
oars. Rising and falling, now on top of a
wave, now out of sight, the boat soon put considerable
distance between the two parties.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Great Frozen Hot Boxes!&#8221; exclaimed
Jimmie in disgust. &#8220;What do you
know about that? They&#8217;ve gone and left us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the ship is settling fast!&#8221; cried Ned,
in alarm. &#8220;We&#8217;d better get busy if we don&#8217;t
want to go down with it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; asked Harry. &#8220;The
boat&#8217;s gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we try to patch up the leak,&#8221; suggested
Jimmie. &#8220;Maybe we could keep the old
tub afloat until the storm dies down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No chance!&#8221; decided Ned. &#8220;Von Kluck
and his crew would have done that if they
could. We&#8217;d better get busy!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with using the small
boat at the stern?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea unless it is broken too
badly. Let&#8217;s have a look at it anyway,&#8221; replied
Ned, hastening toward the stern.
</p>
<p>A brief examination of the small boat indicated
that it would be more seaworthy than
the hull upon which they were standing. No
time was lost in preparations for launching
the craft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When folks get shipwrecked,&#8221; suggested
Jimmie, &#8220;don&#8217;t they take water and food with
them if they have it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They surely do, little man!&#8221; cried Ned.
&#8220;Hustle about and see what you can get. Try
to find something in which to carry fresh
water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jimmie dashed back into the cabin to raid
the pantry. There he found the water gaining
rapidly. It was almost knee deep.
</p>
<p>Splashing his way about with the aid of the
swinging lamp the boy found several loaves
of the hard, black bread with which the vessel
was provisioned. These he wrapped in an oilskin
coat from the captain&#8217;s room. He tucked
the parcel under one arm. With his free hand
he seized a huge piece of the captain&#8217;s beloved
cheese.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>Hastening quickly to the deck he deposited
his burden in the boat. Another trip to the
cabin failed to locate any vessel in which fresh
water could be carried. The boy then dashed
forward to the galley.
</p>
<p>There he found a huge kettle used by the
cook for boiling beef. This Jimmie filled with
water from the barrel on deck. The cover of
the kettle was provided with a clever device
for fastening it in place. This Jimmie secured,
then staggered toward the stern with his
burden.
</p>
<p>Working with desperate speed the four boys
had succeeded in launching the small boat. It
now hung bobbing about to a short length of
painter under the schooner&#8217;s stern. It was not
far below the taffrail.
</p>
<p>Ned and Harry made a hurried trip to the
cabin to secure the kits, returning just as Jimmie
succeeded in placing his kettle of water
aboard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up, Ned,&#8221; cautioned Jack. &#8220;The
little wagon is just about to say &#8216;Goodby&#8217;!
We&#8217;ll have to go some to escape the suction!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; replied Ned, tossing his kit
into the boat.
</p>
<p>Harry pitched the luggage he was carrying
to waiting hands. Both boys then watched for
an opportune moment when the small boat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
swung close to the sinking stern. A quick leap
carried them safely aboard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot!&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;I was going to
bring the compass!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the compass now, Ned!&#8221; cried
Jimmie, seizing an oar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; put in Frank, &#8220;we don&#8217;t know where
we are at anyhow, and the compass wouldn&#8217;t
be of any use to us in such a case as this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodby, Lena Garlic!&#8221; shouted Jimmie a
moment later as he pulled manfully at the oar.
&#8220;Goodby and good luck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others turned to see the schooner now
with decks awash. A loud detonation marked
the blowing off of the hatches by the compressed
air in the hold. That incident seemed
to mark the passage of the vessel.
</p>
<p>Gradually settling by the stern the schooner
quietly slipped backward, settling deeper and
deeper, until a large wave overwhelmed the
craft, leaving only the masts projecting above
water. In another instant these, too, had disappeared,
leaving but a few floating pieces of
wreckage to mark the spot where the boys had
only a short time before been standing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And goodby, Grey Eagle!&#8221; almost sobbed
Ned. &#8220;No more flying in that little airship!
I wish we could have saved the machine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This seemed to be the sentiment of all, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
they knew that their sturdy aeroplane was
now gone forever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Germans needn&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever
trouble them again in that airship!&#8221; declared
Jimmie. &#8220;We can&#8217;t be pinched for that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment the disappointment of their
recent experiences sat heavily on all the lads.
At length, however, Ned roused himself and
tried to cheer his comrades. He knew that
nothing could be gained by bemoaning the fate
that had happened to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t be far from land,&#8221; the lad stated
presently. &#8220;Von Kluck and his crew seemed
to be heading the same way we are. They evidently
knew about where they were and have
made for the nearest port.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s keep right on after them, then,&#8221; suggested
Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Second the motion!&#8221; panted Jimmie,
straining at his oar. &#8220;But this is hot work!
Wish I had a drink of water!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to go slow on the water, boys,&#8221;
cautioned Ned. &#8220;That kettle holds only about
three gallons, and we can&#8217;t drink sea water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me take the oar a while, Jimmie,&#8221; volunteered
Harry. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve worked
about hard enough, anyway. You rest a bit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cautiously the boys changed places. What
with their kits, the bundle of bread and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
cheese the little boat was carrying all that
could be conveniently stowed. They were glad
that no more had remained to accompany
them. Soon all had settled themselves quite
comfortably.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; spoke up Jack, presently, &#8220;all
we&#8217;ve got to do is to let this wind blow us
along. We&#8217;ll just keep the boat straightened
into the seas and take it easy. We can&#8217;t do a
thing to help matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Scout!&#8221; agreed Jimmie. &#8220;I
think it&#8217;s getting gray over there,&#8221; the lad
continued, pointing toward the east. &#8220;Morning
will be along shortly and we can see what
time it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll meet some ship that will pick
us up,&#8221; ventured Harry, hopefully. &#8220;There
are plenty of vessels in these parts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a smoke astern of us now, I think!&#8221;
declared Frank. &#8220;It seems to be from a vessel
low in the water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me take a look,&#8221; cried Ned, standing
and balancing himself by clinging to Jimmie&#8217;s
shoulder. &#8220;Yes, I can see it, too! It seems to
be overhauling us quite rapidly,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll help us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ceasing their efforts to propel the boat the
boys handled the oars only enough to keep
their tiny craft properly riding the seas.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It looks to me like a tug!&#8221; stated Jimmie,
presently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A tug wouldn&#8217;t come smashing along at
that rate!&#8221; objected Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, what can it be?&#8221; queried the
other. &#8220;It is too low in the water for a battleship
and no freight steamer ever made such
good time as they are clipping off! They&#8217;re
coming up fast!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys were not long left in doubt.
Rapidly overhauling them the strange vessel
did, indeed, seem to be at first glance a tug
tearing along through the waves at a great
rate. The bow was lost in a smother of foam
and spray. But a tiny speck of deck house
was visible. The stacks were low. Great billows
of black smoke vomited forth from the
short funnels came drifting down the wind.
</p>
<p>In a short time the vessel approached near
enough so that the boys could distinguish a
small gun mounted at the bow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what that ship is!&#8221; announced Jimmie,
directly. &#8220;That&#8217;s what they call a torpedo
boat destroyer or despatch boat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re right, Jimmie,&#8221; decided
Ned. &#8220;They certainly have got the speed!&#8221;
he added admiringly as the craft approached.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get ready to hail &#8217;em!&#8221; cried Frank. &#8220;Get
out a flag!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t got a flag aboard this wagon!&#8221;
scorned Jimmie. &#8220;What do you think this is&mdash;a
dreadnaught with full equipment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take off your shirt and wave that at
&#8217;em!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the idea!&#8221; agreed Jimmie, proceeding
to follow the advice.
</p>
<p>Bracing himself against a thwart amidships
Jimmie waved the improvised distress signal.
His efforts were not unavailing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They see you, Jimmie!&#8221; shouted Jack,
presently. &#8220;There&#8217;s a man on the bridge looking
at you with glasses. They&#8217;re shifting the
helm!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see two or three men standing on
the bridge!&#8221; announced Ned. &#8220;They are examining
us pretty closely. Wonder who they
are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys were not long left in doubt. Way
was checked on the stranger. As the vessel
drew close to the small boat a churning of
foam at the stern told the lads that the engines
were reversed in an effort to stop. Presently
the stranger ranged alongside. A line was
flung to the boys. They were towed beside
the other under bare steerageway.
</p>
<p>Fending their craft off the larger vessel Ned
explained their plight to an officer. They
were invited aboard the steamer. Their boat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
was hoisted aboard, where it was carefully
stowed.
</p>
<p>The lads found themselves upon the steel
deck of a peculiarly long and narrow vessel.
Guns were mounted forward and aft. Only a
cursory examination was necessary to determine
that they were quick firers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said the officer who had invited
them aboard, &#8220;I shall ask you to step to
the cabin. The commander will hear your
story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the boys entered the cabin in response to
the other&#8217;s request they saw a familiar face.
Beside the commander seated at the table was
none other than their one time acquaintance,
Mackinder.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<a name='XI_A_FLEET_OF_SUBMARINES' id='XI_A_FLEET_OF_SUBMARINES'></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A FLEET OF SUBMARINES</h3>
</div>

<p>Upon seeing Mackinder&#8217;s face, Ned halted
in amazement.
</p>
<p>A smile spread over the other&#8217;s countenance
as he noted Ned&#8217;s look of wonder. But beneath
the appearance of amused indifference
the lad&#8217;s quick eye detected a look of care. He
was not the same Mackinder.
</p>
<p>For a brief moment nothing was said. Then
the officer saluted the commander, who recognized
the act. The boys were presented.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, my friends,&#8221; the commander began,
&#8220;you were adrift on the North Sea in an open
boat? Have you suffered greatly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; replied Ned, acting as
spokesman. &#8220;We have not been adrift very
long. The vessel on which we were riding
struck something which we took to be a floating
mine. The crew got away quickly in one
of the boats, while we left a little later in another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The shrewd eyes of the commander narrowed
perceptibly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what was the name and rig of the
vessel?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Lena Knobloch, a schooner, of Amsterdam,&#8221;
replied Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the name of her captain?&#8221; continued
the commander.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Von Kluck,&#8221; the boy answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, a Hollander! I believe he is a peaceful
trader in small cargoes. He is what the
English call a &#8216;tramp&#8217; of the sea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask what boat this is and where you
are bound?&#8221; asked Ned. &#8220;We would like to
get to the United States, you know,&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; smiled the commander. &#8220;But you
are far from that country now and we think
your company delightful. This vessel is the
Sturmvogel, a destroyer of the German navy.
We have been doing some small tasks upon the
high seas and are returning to a base of supplies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you put us in touch with some means
whereby we can secure passage on a vessel
leaving for the United States?&#8221; asked Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that is impossible for the present,&#8221;
slowly replied the other, with apparent
reluctance. &#8220;We like your company, you see.
We also are favored with the presence of one
of your countrymen,&#8221; here he indicated
Mackinder, &#8220;who has consented to pay us a
brief visit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, sir!&#8221; stated Mackinder, half
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
rising. &#8220;These are <i>not</i> countrymen of mine!
I must disclaim that honor!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So-o-o?&#8221; drawled the other. &#8220;Then you
do not know them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; stated Mackinder positively. &#8220;They
are strangers to me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you did not mean what you said a
few moments ago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was mistaken!&#8221; replied the other, briefly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; responded the commander
with a wave of his hand. &#8220;Perhaps I misunderstood
your statements concerning them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>An order was given to the officer who had
conducted the boys to the cabin. The German
language was used. Saluting the officer approached
Mackinder. Without a word that
gentleman rose and stepped from the room.
</p>
<p>As Mackinder was conducted from the
apartment the commander motioned the boys
to seats about the table. He smiled at them
kindly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what von Kluck&#8217;s cargo consisted
of?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly cheeses,&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;Also an
airship!&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An airship?&#8221; was the questioning response.
&#8220;An airship?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ned smiled a trifle regretfully as he related
briefly the adventures of the four lads with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
those who have read the previous volume of
this series are already familiar. He concluded
by saying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were trying to get ourselves and the
airship back to the United States, when this
man Mackinder seemed bound to delay us on
some flimsy pretext. Unfortunately our Grey
Eagle went down with the schooner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And now you are headed directly
away from your desired destination. For you,
at least, the situation is unfortunate!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We think we are lucky to be afloat!&#8221; declared
Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You are indeed fortunate in that respect.
But I wish to make some inquiries,&#8221;
went on the commander.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be pleased to give you any information
possible,&#8221; answered the lad heartily.
&#8220;We highly appreciate your kindness to us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps my act of picking you up was not
altogether prompted by such a noble sentiment,&#8221;
smiled the other. &#8220;I want some information.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we can help you out,&#8221; replied the
boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want to know is this: What did
you do with the package?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What package?&#8221; puzzled Ned, unable to
grasp the other&#8217;s meaning.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The package so much desired by your
friend Mackinder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Instantly the boys comprehended the statement.
They were unable to understand how
this man should know anything of the mysterious
package unless Mackinder had told
him. They glanced at each other in apprehension.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t we got clear of that thing yet?&#8221;
spoke up Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, sir,&#8221; said Ned, &#8220;we don&#8217;t
really know anything about the package. A
package was found in our baggage when we
were searched at the border between Belgium
and Holland. It was stolen by some person
whom we believe to be this man Mackinder,
who has since been trying to get us to deliver
it to him, although we have not had it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume that you understand him to be
an officer in the British army?&#8221; inquired the
commander kindly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We heard so from von Kluck,&#8221; replied the
boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what was in the package?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. We had not seen it until the time it
was taken from our kits by the soldiers who
were searching them. All we know is that it
was marked &#8216;U-13&#8217; on the outside. We have
seen it but that once.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot understand why Mackinder
should be trying to take the package out of
the possession of his own countrymen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I beg to say that we are not countrymen
of his!&#8221; declared Ned. &#8220;We are citizens
of the United States. Here are our passports!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon!&#8221; apologized the commander.
&#8220;Circumstances seemed to indicate
that you were Englishmen. The mistake is
mine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit that the mistake was natural,&#8221;
said Ned. &#8220;But can you tell me if there is any
connection between the package marked
&#8216;U-13&#8217; and the submarine vessel of the same
name? If there is, why should Mackinder,
an Englishman, have anything to do with the
package?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A smile greeted this query. Clearly the
officer was amused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If, as I suspect,&#8221; he stated presently, &#8220;the
package contained information valuable for
the &#8216;U-13&#8217; do you not understand why Mackinder
would be glad to get possession of it?
The &#8216;U-13&#8217; is a German craft!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;And the two countries
are at war!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will also understand why, under
the circumstances, we must feel honored by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
your presence, as well as that of Mackinder,
for a little time. Just now we should hate to
see you go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we are going to be prisoners?&#8221; asked
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Nothing so harsh as that!&#8221; reassured
the other. &#8220;We will call it simply
guests for the time being. That sounds better!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling us what Mackinder
had to say about us?&#8221; inquired Ned. &#8220;We
would like very much to know that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Consider,&#8221; temporized the officer, &#8220;how
little time there has been since we first sighted
you for conversation of any sort!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed the lad, &#8220;but he has told you
something!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of importance!&#8221; declared the
other, rising to indicate that the interview was
at an end. &#8220;You will be given quarters forward,
where you will receive every consideration
until we reach our destination.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you bound, Captain?&#8221; asked
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our destination just now is a lonely island
in the North Sea,&#8221; answered the other. &#8220;It is
heavily guarded, so you will be in no danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Mackinder go ashore, too?&#8221; Jimmie
continued.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That has not been decided yet,&#8221; replied the
commander. He touched a button, summoning
an orderly. &#8220;Take these young gentlemen
forward and see that they want no comfort.
They are our guests!&#8221; he ordered.
</p>
<p>In a few minutes the boys were seated at a
table in the forecastle, where they were provided
with a great profusion of well-cooked
food from the sailors&#8217; mess. With sharpened
appetites they fell to eagerly.
</p>
<p>Since none of the members of the crew with
whom they came in contact seemed able to
speak English the boys were forced to content
themselves with speculating on their destination.
</p>
<p>They knew that the torpedo boat destroyer
had been headed nearly northeast when it
overhauled, and picked them up. They also
knew that in this direction lay the entrance
to the river Elbe and the Kiel ship canal, but
whether the boat was making for some port
in that vicinity they were unable to learn.
</p>
<p>Keenly as the lads regretted their lack of
definite information they were not inclined to
become despondent. They found it possible
by using signs to carry on a sort of desultory
conversation with the members of the crew,
who had gathered out of curiosity in their
vicinity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>At length Frank jumped from his seat with
an exclamation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I know where we&#8217;re going!&#8221; he announced,
gleefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I!&#8221; stated Jimmie in a nonchalant
manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Frank, somewhat crestfallen.
&#8220;Aw, you don&#8217;t either!&#8221; he declared,
after searching his comrade&#8217;s face intently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; admitted Jimmie, laughing. &#8220;I
just wanted to take some of that overconfidence
out of your system, that&#8217;s all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you think we are bound for,
Frank?&#8221; inquired Ned.
</p>
<p>Frank placed a finger on his lips, glancing
about to make sure that no one was close
enough to overhear his whispered words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Helgoland!&#8221; he said, cautiously.
</p>
<p>Instantly the others jumped to their feet,
slapping Frank&#8217;s shoulders, shaking his hands
and otherwise showing their appreciation of
his shrewdness. Their enthusiasm could
scarcely be restrained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sherlock Shaw, The Scout Sleuth!&#8221;
shouted Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank, you&#8217;re the real, old-fashioned
guesser!&#8221; declared Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you do it, Frank?&#8221; asked Harry,
admiringly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the commander said we were destined
for a lonely island in the North Sea that
was heavily guarded. I guess Helgoland fits
that description right enough. Besides, as I
remember the geography of these parts, that&#8217;s
about the first land we&#8217;d strike going on this
course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I understand that is a sort of naval
base,&#8221; put in Harry. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the island
where the Germans are fitting out so many
of their Zeppelins? Seems to me I read something
about that in a paper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the very place!&#8221; put in Ned. &#8220;The
paper said it was a lonely, rocky island, difficult
of approach and quite well fortified.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And book agents, canvassers, peddlers and
rag men are not allowed there at all!&#8221; asserted
Jimmie, gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take his pie away!&#8221; shouted Jack. &#8220;He&#8217;s
raving again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have to deliver all goods in the
rear,&#8221; added Jimmie, as Jack reached for the
plate containing the lad&#8217;s breakfast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up, let&#8217;s finish this food and get out
on deck, where we will be able to see something,&#8221;
suggested Harry. &#8220;This is interesting!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Directly the boys were standing in the lee
of a deck house eagerly scanning the horizon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
for some sign of the island where they expected
to be landed as prisoners of war.
</p>
<p>The gale gave no hint of abating. Indeed,
the motion of the waves was much more noticeable.
Jack attributed this partly to the
build of the craft, whose lines were sharper
than those of the Lena Knobloch. The sharp
prow cut the water like a knife, while the slender,
tapering stern slipped through the seas
without making a roller of large proportions.
</p>
<p>Presently, just as Jack declared he could
see a blue smudge in the distance, indicating
the presence of land, the lads were joined by
Mackinder. He glanced at the group without
speaking.
</p>
<p>Speedily the vessel approached the object
that had been sighted.
</p>
<p>An officer drew near. He conducted Mackinder
toward the stern.
</p>
<p>As the craft slowed slightly to enter a harbor
Jimmie grasped Ned&#8217;s arm. He pointed
eagerly toward several large objects on land.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a whole flock of Zeppelins,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;And as I live,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I
see a bunch of submarines at that dock over
there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be a dozen or more!&#8221; gasped
Frank, in amazement.
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A NEW &#8220;U-13&#8221; APPEARS</h3>
</div>

<p>Eagerly the lads gazed at the strange sights
before them. On their right rose several huge
buildings; evidently workshops. On the left
they could see a field devoted to the erection
and testing of several gigantic dirigibles.
Everywhere they saw bustling activity on the
part of the numerous workmen. Sentries
paced about with arms in readiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That fleet of submarines looks to me as if
Germany were preparing to destroy every ship
in the world!&#8221; stated Jack presently, as the
destroyer on which they stood passed the undersea
craft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The workmen seem to be fitting out some
of the divers, too!&#8221; ventured Jimmie. &#8220;See
them carrying packages aboard that outside
one!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the grocer is coming to deliver the
goods in the rear!&#8221; laughed Ned. &#8220;Those
packages look like groceries in disguise!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet Mackinder would like to see those
submarines!&#8221; Harry said. &#8220;He&#8217;d give his
eyes almost for one good long look at them!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinder won&#8217;t see enough to carry any
news back home from this place!&#8221; declared
Frank. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see the officer take him
below?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did! I also saw the black look he
gave us as he was being taken away from this
deck house. He likes us a lot&mdash;nit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the commander of this craft is
favorably disposed toward us,&#8221; put in Ned.
&#8220;He probably realizes that we want to be neutral
and that our presence in this neighborhood
is due to our misfortune and not to our
fault. I do wish, though,&#8221; the lad added, &#8220;that
we could leave!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much would you give to get away?&#8221;
questioned Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give a good deal!&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like the idea of remaining on this island
a prisoner for any length of time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;ll make it worth while,&#8221; Jimmie
offered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take you along as a passenger.
You must behave, though!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; smiled Ned, thinking Jimmie was indulging
in another of his jokes. &#8220;May I ask
when your ship leaves?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of leaving about midnight or
a little after,&#8221; stated Jimmie, gravely. &#8220;It
will depend somewhat on the wind and
weather. If it comes on to blow and the sea is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
rough I believe we&#8217;ll get out on time. However,
if this breeze should die away, we may
not go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re rather reversing the order of
things,&#8221; commented Ned. &#8220;Most captains
want clear weather and smooth seas for their
departure!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it remains stormy, as it has every
prospect of doing and you want a swift ride,
you just keep watch of your uncle!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; laughed Ned. &#8220;You may surely
count on me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May we go along, too, Jimmie?&#8221; asked
Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, you may all go!&#8221; answered the lad.
&#8220;But I warn you right now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that
you&#8217;ll have to work your passage!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That suits me!&#8221; returned Harry, greatly
amused at carrying on what he considered as
a pleasant joke to while away the time.
</p>
<p>But to Jimmie, at least, the matter was not
by any means to be regarded as anything but
a serious proposition. The lad had quickly
formulated a plan of escape. The very daring
of his intended action was its best guarantee of
success. Failure meant disaster, but Jimmie
was prepared to risk all in the attempt.
</p>
<p>For a time the lad said no more. His tightly
shut jaws showed the determination that possessed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
him. The others became absorbed in
observing and discussing the monster Zeppelin
dirigibles, hence they said nothing more
upon the subject. There was much to attract
their attention.
</p>
<p>Directly they were summoned before the
commander. As they entered the cabin the
Sturmvogel drew up alongside a dock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young men,&#8221; the officer began as the lads
entered the cabin, &#8220;I regret keenly the circumstances
that seem to make it necessary for us
to detain you. I understand how anxious you
must be to reach your homes, but it is not possible
to permit you to depart at this time. You
will be given every consideration during your
stay at this place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we go with you when you leave
here?&#8221; asked Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that is impossible!&#8221; the other replied,
shaking his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then maybe some other vessel will call and
we can get passage on it? We are not particular
about the class of accommodations!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget that for some distance in every
direction the sea is mined. No vessels approach
this island unless they know the channels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I guess we&#8217;ll have to be contented,&#8221;
sighed the lad.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mackinder going to remain here also?&#8221;
questioned Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sure of it!&#8221; smiled the commander.
&#8220;I believe that several members of
the guard are quite prepared to insist upon his
staying here until the knowledge he now possesses
would be of no use to his own country.
Yes,&#8221; he added, &#8220;Mackinder will remain!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope matters will be arranged so that we
shall soon be able to leave for home,&#8221; stated
Ned. &#8220;We are not anxious to leave good company,
but we would like to get away from the
scene of so much trouble. We want to remain
strictly neutral, and think the best place for
that is at home!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a doubt of your neutrality!&#8221; declared
the officer heartily. &#8220;You may be assured
that I shall do everything to help you.
I believe I can arrange so that certain privileges
will be granted. It will not be necessary,
I am sure, to confine you to one of the buildings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; replied Ned, gratefully.
&#8220;You are most kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, if you please, we will go ashore
to meet the officer in charge of this place,&#8221;
stated the other. &#8220;You will like him, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Congratulating themselves on the kindness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
shown in their behalf the boys prepared to
leave the Sturmvogel. They collected the kits
of the four who had left Amsterdam on the
Lena Knobloch. As they gained the dock they
found the small boat in which they had left
the schooner. It was evidently being preserved
as evidence of the circumstance of the
rescue.
</p>
<p>Already the work of provisioning and fitting
the vessel was in progress. The wireless had
been busily used during the last few hours of
their voyage to the end that just the supplies
needed were waiting at the wharf. A huge
coal barge fitted with a &#8220;whirlie&#8221; had drawn
up alongside. Great buckets of coal were
pouring into the bunkers, while porters carried
all sorts of stores and supplies aboard.
Cases of ammunition were being hoisted
aboard and stowed in their proper compartments.
</p>
<p>Stepping along the dock, dodging wagons
loaded with fresh provisions and stores, the
boys kept pace with their friend, the commander.
</p>
<p>Presently they reached one of the buildings
given over to the use of offices. Here they
were admitted into a room, where they found
the officer in command of the island.
</p>
<p>A short conversation in German served to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
inform this gentleman of the situation so far
as the commander of the destroyer could report.
At the end of the recital the boys were
addressed by the one they had been brought
to visit, who had been introduced as General
Gruenwold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that you young gentlemen
lost an airship when the schooner sank?&#8221; he
inquired of Ned, motioning the boys to chairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir!&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;It was, of course,
a complete loss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you understand machinery pretty
well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have always thought so,&#8221; was the modest
reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And electricity?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. We understand wireless, also.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I am fortunate. Perhaps you would
consent to assist us in some difficult technical
tasks we have on hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be glad to do what we may to
reimburse you for our keep if you will be good
enough to assist us to return to the United
States!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us discuss that at another time, if you
please,&#8221; replied Gruenwold. &#8220;Just now we
are short of practical electricians. If you will
offer your services in that direction we shall
be very grateful. You may be sure that we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
shall not be forgetful when it is possible to
reciprocate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied Ned in acknowledgment
of the indirect promise. &#8220;Now, if you
will show us what you want done we shall be
most happy to proceed. I believe we have
nothing else to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are some plans,&#8221; stated the other,
opening a cabinet at one side of the room. &#8220;In
these compartments are plans of certain vessels.
You will observe on these sheets marked
&#8216;elek.&#8217; complete diagrams of the plan of wiring.
Take this one, for instance. Do you
think you could understand what is meant by
these tracings?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ned studied the diagram for a few moments.
The other boys leaned over his shoulder. Presently,
after conferring with his friends, the
lad announced that he understood the drawings
perfectly, even though he was unable to
read the explanations which were in the German
language.
</p>
<p>A smile lighted the face of Gruenwold as
this statement was made. Evidently the need
for completing the work was urgent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, we will ask you to accompany
this orderly on board the vessel and proceed
with the work. I will write an order directing
the ones in charge of the vessel to admit you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
and render such aid as may be necessary.
Later I will send a man who can speak
English.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While the general was writing the necessary
order to the ones in charge of the vessel
to which he had referred the boys were busy
communicating with each other by means of
the mute language, in which they were quite
adept. By supreme efforts they were able to
suppress the excitement under which they
were laboring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a piece of luck!&#8221; rapidly signalled
Jimmie to Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep cool!&#8221; cautioned Ned in reply.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t give it away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Insist that we stay together on the job,&#8221;
returned Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be sure I shall do that!&#8221; came the
answer instantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the storm increases!&#8221; was Jack&#8217;s
contribution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; announced the general,
&#8220;if you are ready to proceed you may accompany
this man. He will direct you to the
work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ned bowed in acknowledgment and the
party turned to accompany the orderly, who
appeared in answer to the summons of his
superior.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>They were led away from the dock at which
the Sturmvogel lay. In a short time they had
traversed a goodly distance toward the mouth
of the harbor. Their destination proved to be
the building adjacent to the group of submarine
vessels. By inquiries both direct and
indirect Ned and his companions decided that
the orderly was unable to comprehend
English, but for the sake of absolute safety
they continued to use the sign language
largely in their conversation as they proceeded.
</p>
<p>In a short time they had been admitted to
the outermost craft, which lay moored to its
fellows. Communication had been established
between the vessels by means of a row of
planks laid from deck to deck.
</p>
<p>Once inside the submarine the boys made
a hurried yet thorough examination of every
part, taking a complete inventory of the exact
state of affairs. Frank and Jimmie managed
to overhaul the stores. Harry and Jack looked
over the mechanical equipment. Ned, with the
plans in his hands, went carefully over every
detail of the electric system.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, fellows,&#8221; announced Ned at length,
as all the lads met beneath the hatch, &#8220;this
wagon is nearly complete. It looks a lot like
the &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it does!&#8221; agreed Jimmie.
&#8220;What more is needed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A few pieces of wire and about an hour&#8217;s
work for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank and I have found enough food to
last a couple of months if we can count hardtack,
sausage, and the supply of canned
goods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack and I,&#8221; announced Harry, &#8220;have
found the engines and pumps apparently
ready for duty in a moment. My idea is that
they are trying to get this vessel ready for a
cruise at the first possible moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if they are expecting a crew
from some place and want the boat ready for
duty as soon as the crew arrives!&#8221; stated Ned.
</p>
<p>Further conversation was cut short by the
arrival of the orderly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Essen?&#8221; he inquired, pointing at his mouth
and rubbing his belt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it twice!&#8221; cried Jimmie. &#8220;We
heard you the first time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys prepared to follow the orderly,
who evidently intended to escort them to the
mess hall, where they would secure dinner.
</p>
<p>As they turned toward the iron ladder leading
to the hatch Jimmie, who had followed
close upon the orderly&#8217;s heels, cried out:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Mackinder, where you from?&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A THREATENING SITUATION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there, Jimmie?&#8221; asked Ned, pressing
forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody now,&#8221; answered the other. &#8220;I
thought I saw our friend Mackinder looking
down the hatchway, but possibly I was mistaken.
At any rate he&#8217;s gone now and we&#8217;d
better hurry on for dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinder&#8217;s a prisoner here,&#8221; stated Ned,
positively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he broke loose,&#8221; suggested Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;m going up to the deck and
look about,&#8221; said Ned.
</p>
<p>As the boys reached the narrow confines of
the small deck at the top of the conning tower
they saw a figure hastening along the foot
planks that led from vessel to vessel. The
fleeing person was now almost at the building
on the wharf. In a moment the shelter of this
structure had been gained. The figure dodged
out of sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s a funny thing to do!&#8221; mused
Ned. &#8220;I wonder just what the fellow wanted.
Are you sure it was Mackinder, Jimmie?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not,&#8221; admitted the lad. &#8220;Of
course, the face was in shadow as he looked
down the hatch. I&#8217;m not positive, but thought
it was he.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s not bother about it any more,&#8221;
said Ned, apparently dismissing the subject.
&#8220;We&#8217;re too hungry for any more mysteries!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As only hungry boys can the five attacked
the ample dinner provided for them. The
dishes were strange but appetizing. Jimmie
declared that he intended to remain in that
location for some time in order to become acquainted
with the chef. He said that he would
be the envy of the entire Wolf Patrol if he
could cook in German style.
</p>
<p>After dinner the boys gathered in the lee
of a small building, where they would be protected
from the chilling blasts. Puffy squalls,
bearing dashes of snow, sleet or rain, came
threshing out of the west. It appeared to the
lads that the weather was growing decidedly
worse.
</p>
<p>In spite of the inclement weather a number
of the hardy workmen were indulging in out
of door sports during their rest hour.
</p>
<p>For some time the lads watched the games
as the hardy men relaxed their work-tensed
muscles. The sullen booming of surf on the
rocky coast constantly sounded in their ears.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There goes our late rescuer!&#8221; announced
Jimmie presently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Frank. &#8220;Whom do you
mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sturmvogel!&#8221; answered Jimmie,
pointing toward the harbor, where could be
seen the speedy destroyer slipping quietly out
to sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s hoping you have a good voyage,
friend!&#8221; said Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added Jimmie, &#8220;we&#8217;ll see you a little
later!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That reminds me,&#8221; put in Ned, &#8220;we might
as well get back to the &#8216;U-13&#8217; and begin work.
There&#8217;s no use delaying the game!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Harry. &#8220;These fellows
are probably in a hurry for that submarine.
We might as well be decent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; suggested Jimmie.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve given me an idea! Your mention of
the name of a certain undersea craft started a
train of thought in my alleged brain. Take it
easy for a moment!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried Jack, in mock sympathy,
&#8220;stand back! Give him air! If Jimmie is
really going to think, let&#8217;s give him lots of
room!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, you go on!&#8221; scorned Jimmie. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
got a right to think if I want to, haven&#8217;t I? I
guess that&#8217;s my privilege!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless you have a union card!&#8221; protested
Jack, laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; retorted Jimmie with a
grin as he wrinkled a freckled nose at the
other. &#8220;I was going to think about a scab,
anyhow, so I don&#8217;t need a card. Besides, this
is on overtime!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, you win!&#8221; declared Jack, submissively.
&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll promise to never, never tell, I&#8217;ll
let you in on the scheme!&#8221; whispered Jimmie,
glancing about to make sure that no strangers
were within earshot. &#8220;Do you solemnly
promise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do!&#8221; answered the boys in chorus, anxious
to receive the news.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then here it is: If we could paint the
name &#8216;U-13&#8217; on that tub there&#8217;s nothing to
prevent our getting away in it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Jimmie!&#8221; cautioned Ned, in a
startled tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush nothing!&#8221; declared the other boldly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s now or never! The destroyer&#8217;s gone&mdash;everything&#8217;s
gone that could chase us. Mackinder&#8217;s
loose on this island. He&#8217;ll make us
trouble if we stay. If we go now we are safe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
from pursuit until another German boat comes
in unless they flash the news by wireless. In
that case, we have an even chance of getting
away. If we don&#8217;t go now tell me when we can
get home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right, Jimmie, but how are
you going to work it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply putter along this afternoon,&#8221; explained
the lad, &#8220;fixing the wiring and so on.
If necessary, rip out some and replace it. We
can get in one another&#8217;s way enough to kill a
lot of time. After supper we&#8217;ll manage to slip
back to the submarine, paint &#8216;U-13&#8217; on the
side, every man to his post, let go lines easy
and skedaddle for the open sea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds easy enough,&#8221; assented Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, unless you happen to get caught!&#8221;
agreed Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is there to catch us?&#8221; asked Jimmie,
bristling at this hint of opposition. &#8220;The
guards are all wise to the fact that the channel
is mined. They will be sleepy and lazy. They
know that the torpedoes are not aboard yet
and believe it impossible for the submarine to
leave without a crew. The weather looks as
if it were going to be rough. What more can
you want? It looks to me as if we&#8217;d never
have another chance like it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Mr. Wolf!&#8221; declared Frank.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
&#8220;I, for one, am willing to take a chance. I&#8217;ll
go with you to the limit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, too!&#8221; heartily agreed Ned. &#8220;How
about it, boys?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eagerly the others signified their willingness
to undertake the task suggested. They
felt no compunction over the seizure of the
boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ll have to do some tall thinking
before night comes!&#8221; stated Jimmie. &#8220;Each
of us&#8217;ll have his station and we must know
just what to do at the proper time. I had this
in mind ever since we came up the harbor past
those boats. I noticed particularly the buoys
marking the safe channel leading into this
harbor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you!&#8221; cried Ned, administering
an affectionate slap upon Jimmie&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;I knew you had something up your sleeve!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I!&#8221; added Jack. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t guess
what it was, though!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my arm!&#8221; declared Jimmie, with
mock gravity. &#8220;Now, let&#8217;s go back to this
&#8216;Untervasserbootschiff&#8217; and stall around a
while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Correct!&#8221; cried Harry. &#8220;We&#8217;ll rehearse
for this evening. We shall depend on Jimmie
to be the pilot, though!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Leave it to me!&#8221; declared the younger lad.
&#8220;I know where the buoys are! I have them
all located in my head!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we must be mighty careful,&#8221; declared
Ned. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know how much English
these fellows understand. They must not suspect!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mum&#8217;s the word!&#8221; put in Frank. &#8220;Everybody
mum!&#8221;
</p>
<p>First visiting the warehouse at the wharf,
where they procured a quantity of supplies,
such as might be needed to carry out the work
which they were supposed to be doing, the lads
proceeded aboard the submarine.
</p>
<p>Upon their arrival they found a painter at
work inscribing the vessel with identifying
marks. He had proceeded so far as to place
&#8220;U-1&mdash;&#8221; on each side of the vessel. Jimmie
joyfully declared that fortune was playing
into their hands in this respect, and that if
something would compel the man to quit
work for a while the disguise could be quickly
made.
</p>
<p>At Ned&#8217;s request Harry began fitting wires
from the storage batteries to the motors used
for propelling the vessel. The boys were
startled to hear him utter an exclamation of
dismay. They found upon inquiry that he
had endeavored to strip the insulation from a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
wire by using his pocket knife and had cut a
finger badly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, pooh!&#8221; stated Jimmie, upon discovering
the wound. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make so much fuss
over a little thing like that. We&#8217;ll soon have
you fixed up. Here, just hold the wound
closed with your other hand while I hunt up
some bandages. You&#8217;ll be all right in a minute!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Harry declared that the wound pained
excessively. He refused to treat the matter
lightly, but gathered up the tools with which
he had been working. These he deposited in
a canvas bag in which they had been brought
aboard the vessel.
</p>
<p>Presently Jimmie located a first aid kit
among the stores. He was not long in cleansing
and bandaging the wound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are!&#8221; he stated. &#8220;Just as good
as new! Now go lie down for a little while.
I&#8217;ll finish this job if I know enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chatting together in a somewhat nervous
manner the boys anxiously awaited the approach
of evening. As the time wore on their
restlessness increased. Again and again they
carefully went over each detail of their proposed
plan for escape in the submarine.
</p>
<p>It was decided that Jimmie should take the
wheel while Harry stood watch at the engines.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
The others were assigned to various other
duties at favorable positions. Nothing remained
except to wait for night.
</p>
<p>A short time before darkness settled an orderly
visited the craft. He was able to converse
slightly in English.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you getting along, boys?&#8221; he
asked, as he stepped down the iron ladder.
&#8220;Can we put the torpedoes aboard tomorrow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think you will be able to place the
torpedoes after tomorrow morning,&#8221; replied
Ned. &#8220;We will have our work all done then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good!&#8221; was the other&#8217;s comment.
&#8220;Where is Mackinder?&#8221; was his next question.
&#8220;He will have to come ashore now!&#8221; he
added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinder?&#8221; was Ned&#8217;s startled response.
&#8220;He&#8217;s not here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he was here!&#8221; firmly declared the orderly.
&#8220;He was seen by one of the sentries
to come aboard this vessel, and has not since
been noticed going ashore, although a close
watch has been kept!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen him at all!&#8221; stated Ned,
just as firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have to search the vessel!&#8221;
affirmed the orderly. &#8220;You will please remain
aboard for a short time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>Quickly ascending the ladder the man summoned
another soldier from the shore. Together
the two made a hasty examination of
the boat.
</p>
<p>Unable to discover any trace of the missing
prisoner they shook their heads as if greatly
puzzled. Now and again they glanced at the
boys, exchanging at the same time comments
in German.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with us,&#8221; finally said the first visitor.
</p>
<p>Obediently the lads followed ashore. They
were conducted to the office building, where
they were shown into the presence of General
Gruenwold at once. In a few words the orderly
stated the case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks serious, boys,&#8221; commented the
General. &#8220;Can you not explain the whereabouts
of Mackinder? He is a prisoner, you
know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know nothing of the man!&#8221; declared
Ned, earnestly. &#8220;We don&#8217;t like him and
surely would not think of assisting him to
escape!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, sir,&#8221; began the orderly, &#8220;it
is the opinion of my comrade and myself that
the boys have done away with Mackinder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; almost shouted Gruenwold, rising
from his chair.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; continued the man. &#8220;There was
found in the boat much blood. A hammer in
their tool kit was also blood-stained. We
think they possibly made away with him and
might have dropped his body into the harbor
very quietly without being seen from shore!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is serious, indeed!&#8221; gasped Gruenwold.
&#8220;We shall investigate this in the morning.
Meanwhile, search the vessel again. The
boys will be put in the guardhouse until tomorrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Protests on the part of the lads were unavailing.
Gruenwold was determined in his decision.
Ned&#8217;s explanation of the presence of
the blood in the vessel was listened to, but
without influencing the general.
</p>
<p>Directly the lads found themselves in a
room used for the accommodation of such
prisoners as might need confinement for a
time. The island boasted no regular prison,
but a house not far from the water had been
utilized for the purpose. A guard paced a
beat in the vicinity.
</p>
<p>Disappointed and angry at the turn of
affairs the lads made but a poor supper of the
food that was brought to them. Presently
they composed themselves to sleep on the floor.
</p>
<p>A tapping at the window attracted their attention.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>HELPED BY AN ENEMY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; inquired Ned, startled at
the unexpected sound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Loose board, I guess,&#8221; replied Jimmie,
rather disgruntled at the turn affairs had
taken. &#8220;The wind&#8217;s ripping everything
loose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the tapping was repeated in an insistent
manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see what&#8217;s going on here!&#8221;
declared Ned, rising from his position. &#8220;Some
one is trying to communicate with us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some bloomin&#8217; Dutchman&#8217;s tryin&#8217; to ask
us whether we want sausage with our pancakes
for breakfast!&#8221; growled Jimmie. &#8220;Let
&#8217;em alone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Disregarding this statement the older lad
proceeded toward the window, where fitful
gusts of sleet beat. Outside the darkness covered
everything. Only an occasional point of
light indicated a sentry hut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; demanded Ned in a low
tone.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sh-h-h!&#8221; came a hiss from the darkness.
&#8220;Open the window!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ned fumbled a moment at the fastening.
Presently he found the catch sliding the sash
back in its channel. An exclamation escaped
him as he did so. The face of the visitor was
none other than that of their missing acquaintance,
Mackinder. Ned was astounded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought you were dead!&#8221; he cried in
amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; cautioned the other. &#8220;Not so
loud. Now, if you lads want to get out of here
this is your time. Everybody&#8217;s busy or
asleep!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know we want to get out of
here?&#8221; demanded Jimmie in a low tone as he
approached the opening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose I have eyes? I saw
what you were up to!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you did, eh? Then what do you want
us to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to get away from this place
according to your plan, now is the time to take
action,&#8221; replied Mackinder in a whisper. &#8220;If
you prefer to wait until tomorrow and stand
trial for an offense of which you are innocent
I cannot offer any objection of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ned, I think we&#8217;d better make our getaway
while the going&#8217;s good!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Second the motion!&#8221; declared Harry, who
had softly approached the window. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
make a noise like a drum!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you!&#8221; stated Frank, raising a
foot to the window sill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy there!&#8221; cautioned Jimmie. &#8220;Mind
your step!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Frank was through the window in an instant.
He landed on the earth with Mackinder&#8217;s
assistance without noise. Quickly the
others followed. Ned took the precaution to
slide the window shut.
</p>
<p>Cautiously the little group of six made their
way in the direction of the wharf where the
submarines were moored. Mackinder took the
lead as if familiar with the ground. Once he
paused, extending a warning hand to Jimmie,
who was directly behind him. The lad performed
a similar service for those in the rear.
A sentry was approaching.
</p>
<p>Mackinder sank upon the ground. Although
the night was too dark for the lads to see this
action they were close enough to be aware of
the movement. Instantly all followed suit.
</p>
<p>In a moment they breathed more freely. The
sentry had passed within a few paces of their
position. Evidently his feeling of security in
the isolation of the island had made him somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
negligent of his duties. He proceeded
against the storm with head bent low.
</p>
<p>Again Mackinder rose to his feet. Cautiously
he crept forward.
</p>
<p>On tiptoe the party gained the shelter of the
warehouse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; declared Jimmie as the edge of the
wharf was gained, &#8220;I clean forgot my kit!
What shall we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; warned Ned. &#8220;Don&#8217;t even dare
think of your kit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not!&#8221; put in Harry. &#8220;Think
of your head instead!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the mines at the harbor entrance,&#8221;
added Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; submissively agreed Jimmie.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep quiet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The wind had risen to such an extent that
walking on the narrow planking was not only
uncertain but extremely dangerous. Mackinder
solved the problem by dropping to all
fours. The boys followed suit.
</p>
<p>Directly they gained the submarine, the
hatch was placed quietly in position for
prompt closing and the lines which held the
boat were let go.
</p>
<p>Owing to the movement of the boats caused
by the roughened surface of the harbor creakings
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
and groanings of the fenders had served
to drown any noise the party had made in
crossing the narrow bridge of planks.
</p>
<p>Jimmie held the wheel as Ned gave the signal
for casting off the lines. A touch of Harry&#8217;s
hand on the lever started the engines. The
submarine began to move. Suddenly a loud
splash alongside attracted the attention of all.
Frank came scuttling down the ladder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve done it!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;I forgot
to shove the plank back onto the next boat
and it fell into the water as we started!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder if the guard has heard it!&#8221; speculated
Ned. &#8220;Let me up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Under protests from his companions the lad
mounted the iron ladder and thrust his head
through the hatch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear someone running along the dock!&#8221;
he announced presently. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet they have
heard that noise! I see a light!&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they doing?&#8221; inquired Jimmie,
holding the boat directly in the center of the
channel as he peered anxiously ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fellow with a lantern is running out
along the planks,&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got
to the outside boat now. Now they&#8217;re turning
back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better get that hatch closed so we can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
dive,&#8221; admonished Jimmie. &#8220;This is our time
for getting out of sight in a hurry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There goes their searchlight!&#8221; shouted
Frank, who had crowded up the ladder close
beside Ned. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to spot us in a
hurry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; cried Ned as a sullen roar came to
their ears. &#8220;They&#8217;re taking a chance shot at
us from that cannon on the hill. Let&#8217;s dive!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Quickly the two boys adjusted the hatch.
As they signaled to their companions that this
task was completed Harry and Jack turned
the deflecting rudders. The half-manned submarine
slowly began to descend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get some water into the tanks quick,
Harry!&#8221; called Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pump&#8217;s going right now!&#8221; declared the
other. &#8220;We&#8217;re going down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a look through the periscope, Ned,&#8221;
requested the pilot, &#8220;and let me know what
you can make out. Can you see any buoys
ahead?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to see if they&#8217;ve located us with their
searchlight,&#8221; suggested Mackinder. &#8220;Maybe
they are getting our range with that gun!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about that searchlight,&#8221;
snapped Jimmie. &#8220;I want to find out what&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
ahead, not what&#8217;s behind us. We&#8217;ll run this
boat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I simply wanted to know,&#8221; objected Mackinder
somewhat ruffled at the lad&#8217;s peremptory
manner. &#8220;No objection, is there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the objection in the world!&#8221; declared
Jimmie. &#8220;You&#8217;re quite welcome aboard as a
passenger, but we&#8217;ll navigate the vessel,
please!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Scarcely knowing whether to be amused or
defiant at this attitude Mackinder chose the
wiser course and refrained from further comment.
</p>
<p>Although the boys could not be sure that the
persons on the island were making efforts to
hinder their escape they felt the better course
was to remain beneath the surface until well
out of the harbor.
</p>
<p>Directly Jimmie called the attention of his
comrades to an object in the water at no great
distance ahead. The rays of the searchlight
with which the submarine was provided indistinctly
revealed a huge bulk slightly above the
level at which they were traveling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that, a ship?&#8221; asked Harry wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet a cookie that&#8217;s a mine!&#8221; declared
Jimmie positively. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give it a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
little more leeway, anyhow. It pays to be
safe!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ned was working the periscope in an effort
to locate the buoys as directed by Jimmie.
Occasionally he turned the glass toward the
group of buildings they had just left.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re shooting at us, I guess!&#8221; he stated
presently. &#8220;I can see the flash of that cannon.
It seems to be pointed this way!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em shoot, they can&#8217;t see anything but
the periscope and they&#8217;d have an awful time
hitting that!&#8221; boasted Jimmie.
</p>
<p>Scarcely had the lad spoken before the vessel
was shaken by the force of a mighty concussion.
A gigantic wave tossed the craft up
and forward with a heave that threw the boys
off their feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; gasped Jimmie glancing
at his companions with a terrified face. &#8220;Has
one of the fuel tanks blown up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing doing!&#8221; replied Harry. &#8220;I think
that cannon hit the mine we just passed. I&#8217;m
glad we were no closer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon be out of their range!&#8221; stated
Jimmie. &#8220;Shut up your periscope and we&#8217;ll
go deeper. Give us a little more speed,
Harry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In an hour Jimmie declared that they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
should be out of sight of the island altogether.
The engines had been working at full speed
ahead. Harry nursed the machinery constantly,
knowing that it was new and would,
therefore, require considerable care. Their
urgent need for speed induced the lads to
crowd the machinery to the limit, and Harry
was gratified to note that every part responded
properly to its task.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mackinder,&#8221; stated Ned as the tension
on their nerves began to relax with the
increasing distance traveled, &#8220;we&#8217;re surely
grateful to you for suggesting that we get
away as you did!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My motive was largely a selfish one, I must
confess,&#8221; returned Mackinder. &#8220;I wanted very
badly to get away from that island.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did they ever get hold of you, anyhow?&#8221;
questioned Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I left Amsterdam the same evening you
did. After the Lena Knobloch went past us
as she did I knew there was little use trying
to delay you. Therefore, my aide and myself
left at once on a train for Rotterdam. There
we found a fishing boat which we thought
would answer our purpose. We induced the
captain to take us aboard, intending to cross
to England. After traveling some distance the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
storm overtook us. We were blown far out of
our course. The vessel was badly battered.
The crew left in a panic, leaving me on board.
Just in time the German destroyer came along
and took me off. That&#8217;s it in a nutshell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and then when you discovered us in
our little boat you went and told the captain
of the destroyer a lot of nonsense, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
questioned Jimmie in a somewhat aggressive
manner. &#8220;Why did you do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only told him that you had at one time a
package that belonged to me. I wanted
the package badly. I thought he would assist
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t a very nice way to go about
it,&#8221; declared Jimmie with emphasis. &#8220;After
searching our baggage twice, and after we had
told you how the package was in our kits
without our knowledge, also that it had been
stolen away from our possession, why didn&#8217;t
you believe us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an old saying that all is fair in
love and war!&#8221; replied Mackinder. &#8220;You
know that my country and Germany are at
war. As an officer in the British army, it is
my duty to do everything possible to assist
my country. I believe that package contains
information that my country could use. That
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
is my justification for my acts, and I hope you
boys are fair-minded enough to hold no resentment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just fair-minded enough to be neutral,&#8221;
declared Jimmie, &#8220;if I have to fight for
the right to remain that way. I&#8217;m just a little
sore at you for supposing that four boys who
are citizens of a neutral country would be carrying
information around for another country
at war!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you feel that way,&#8221; said Mackinder.
&#8220;I assure you there was nothing personal
in my acts. I simply tried to do my
best!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you did a lot, at that!&#8221; returned the
lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, folks, let&#8217;s drop the subject,&#8221;
spoke up Ned. &#8220;I feel that the air in here is
getting bad. Suppose we go to the surface.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; agreed Harry. &#8220;Let&#8217;s rise
and fill the tanks!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jimmie, in compliance with this wish,
steered the craft upward.
</p>
<p>At the surface the boys found the water
much smoother than they had expected would
be the case. Jimmie declared that he intended
painting the balance of the name &#8220;U-13&#8221; on
the vessel while the other lads were occupied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
in airing out the vessel and refilling the compressed
air tanks.
</p>
<p>Slung in a boatswain&#8217;s chair over the sloping
deck the lad soon completed this task.
Feeling a considerable degree of elation at the
success of his undertaking Jimmie returned
with his brush and paint.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re ready now we&#8217;ll dive again and
proceed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Mackinder&#8217;s still on deck!&#8221;
stated Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t there when I came below!&#8221; protested
Jimmie.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>MISTAKEN IDENTITY</h3>
</div>

<p>Ned looked at Jimmie in astonishment. He
could scarcely credit his senses. He began ascending
the iron ladder leading to the deck.
</p>
<p>Eagerly the lad glanced about the upper
portion of the submarine which now showed
black and gleaming above the surface of the
water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; he called down the hatchway,
&#8220;didn&#8217;t Mackinder say he was coming on deck
to see if he could be of service to Jimmie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly did!&#8221; answered Harry.
&#8220;Then we went on working at the pumps. I
was busy with the starboard pump because it
wasn&#8217;t working just as it should. I saw him
start up the ladder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I saw him when he was about half
way up!&#8221; put in Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m equally certain he didn&#8217;t return, but
it may be well enough to stop a minute to
search the interior. Perhaps he came back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a moment all five boys were busily going
over every corner of the craft. From stem to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
stern they ransacked every place where it
would have been at all possible for their guest
to have hidden.
</p>
<p>At length they met in the space directly
below the hatchway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Find anything?&#8221; queried Ned glancing
about the group.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a hint of anything at all resembling an
Englishman!&#8221; stated Jimmie. &#8220;Perhaps it
would be a good idea to put an ad. in the
paper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; scorned Jack. &#8220;Like this: &#8216;Lost&mdash;one
perfectly good Englishman. Finder please
return to the &#8220;U-13&#8221; and receive reward&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; agreed Jimmie. &#8220;Have them
charge it, please!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush this nonsense, boys!&#8221; cried Ned.
&#8220;This may be serious!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, where is he?&#8221; protested Jimmie.
&#8220;We haven&#8217;t got him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he fell overboard!&#8221; suggested Ned.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the lad mounted the ladder. As he
reached the small deck he peered anxiously
about the vessel seeking what he hoped he
might not find.
</p>
<p>The others came crowding after their chum,
filling the space.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There he goes!&#8221; cried Jimmie pointing
away to the north.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; inquired Ned looking in the direction
indicated. &#8220;Oh, I see him,&#8221; the lad
went on. &#8220;He&#8217;s swimming a good stroke,
too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he crazy or just disgusted with the company
on board the &#8216;U-13&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he thinks he&#8217;ll be picked up by
that boat!&#8221; stated Jimmie again directing the
attention of his comrades to a small fishing
craft. &#8220;They seem to be heading a course
that will reach Mackinder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was wise enough to take one of the
life preservers,&#8221; said Harry indicating a space
from which a buoy was missing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough!&#8221; agreed Ned. &#8220;He&#8217;s no fool
at any rate!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s wait a while to see if they pick him
up,&#8221; suggested Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t get him, we&#8217;ll chase over
there and take him aboard again. What do
you say?&#8221; asked Ned of the others.
</p>
<p>There was no dissenting voice raised to this
suggestion. Eagerly the lads watched the
boat momentarily drawing nearer the
swimmer.
</p>
<p>In a short time the boat rounded to, losing
her way in the water. A sharp skiff was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
quickly launched over the side. Into this
tumbled two men. They soon covered the distance
between their vessel and the swimmer.
Without difficulty they succeeded in assisting
Mackinder into the skiff, then put quickly
back to the sailing vessel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, he&#8217;s safe at any rate!&#8221; gladly stated
Ned. &#8220;Now we can go on and finish our voyage
in peace! I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I!&#8221; declared Jimmie. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
good fellow as one might say, but he&#8217;s too
awfully stuck on getting some information
for that bloomin&#8217; Hinglish Harmy, don&#8217;t you
know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s hardly fair, Jimmie!&#8221; laughed Ned.
&#8220;He didn&#8217;t drop his &#8216;H&#8217;s&#8217; and he did only
what he considered his duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He will probably get that fisherman to set
him ashore on English soil as soon as possible,&#8221;
conjectured Jack. &#8220;Suppose we follow
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; asked Harry. &#8220;Why should
we chase after those chaps?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless we do something of the sort, we&#8217;ll
have to go at it blindly!&#8221; urged Jack. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t really know where we are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; admitted Harry reluctantly.
&#8220;We haven&#8217;t a chart nor a course. We don&#8217;t
know how far we are from anywhere at all!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We might keep on steering just as we
started,&#8221; stated Frank. &#8220;I believe southeast
was the course we used coming away from
Helgoland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That course would surely bring us up
somewhere,&#8221; put in Ned, &#8220;but it would be
much better if we could find out exactly where
we are. Then we could steer a course with
intelligence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, what do we need of a chart?&#8221; scorned
Jimmie. &#8220;We know that England lies to the
southwest of us. It&#8217;s big enough so we can&#8217;t
miss it. If we blunder into the coast we can
just cruise along a ways until we come to some
place or other and then head in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea, too,&#8221; agreed Frank.
&#8220;When we get to a port we can turn the submarine
over to the English authorities as a
prize of war. They&#8217;ll probably be glad enough
to get the machine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll head for the little old U. S. A.!&#8221;
cried Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right we will. When we get there,
we&#8217;ll chase ourselves out to Long Island. The
first thing I&#8217;ll do will be to get the factory
started on another engine like the Grey
Eagle&#8217;s!&#8221; declared Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough! Now let&#8217;s be &#8216;wenting&#8217;!&#8221;
added Jimmie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But, boys,&#8221; objected Ned, &#8220;this hit or
miss fashion of navigating is not correct.
Something may happen to change our course.
If we don&#8217;t know what we are doing, we might
get into lots of trouble!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right, Ned!&#8221; assented Frank.
&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better cruise carefully along
on the surface until we see a ship. We can
ask them for our latitude and longitude. From
that we&#8217;ll be able to lay a course to any point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll give us a chart, too!&#8221; put
in Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, here goes!&#8221; shouted
Jimmie preparing to slide down the ladder.
&#8220;Somebody&#8217;ll have to keep on deck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry at once followed Jimmie into the
interior. The engines responded to his touch.
The new &#8220;U-13&#8221; sprang forward half submerged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got plenty of gas in the tanks,
Harry,&#8221; stated Jimmie to his chum as the
latter moved about the interior looking after
the machinery. &#8220;We&#8217;re making only about
fifteen miles now by this log.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give them another touch,&#8221; responded
Harry. &#8220;The sooner we get there, the quicker
we&#8217;ll arrive, so here goes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The increased speed of the engines urged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
the submarine ahead at a goodly rate. Jimmie
presently declared that the log indicator
showed a good twenty-five miles an hour.
Those on the little deck above the conning
tower found the increased speed uncomfortable
by reason of the dashing spray, but all
felt that this was not unendurable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sail, ho!&#8221; Ned presently called down the
hatchway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where away?&#8221; asked Harry, looking up at
his comrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost dead ahead!&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;We&#8217;re
overhauling them fast. It looks to be a three
masted ship as nearly as I can make out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your course, Jimmie!&#8221; directed Jack.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll come up close enough to hail them in
a little while just as we are heading!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a few minutes the ship was so close that
all could make out the details of her rigging.
It was a large three masted square-rigged
vessel evidently in ballast for the hull was
high out of water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe they see us!&#8221; announced Frank,
using a pair of binoculars he had found
among the fittings of the submarine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you make out the flag at the peak?&#8221;
asked Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so. I believe it is the British
flag.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then, they&#8217;ll be glad to help us out, especially
if they find that we intend to turn the
&#8216;U-13&#8217; over to their government!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that!&#8221; doubted Frank.
&#8220;I see men running aloft. It looks as if they&#8217;re
rigging out studding sail booms on the main
yards. And I see others on the topsail yards,&#8221;
declared the boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, in that case, they&#8217;re trying to get
away from us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly looks that way. Now I can
see men setting the studding sails on the
booms. They are putting on every rag the
old hooker will carry!&#8221; cried the lad excitedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know why,&#8221; stated Harry. &#8220;They think
we&#8217;re a German submarine chasing them and
they&#8217;re trying to get away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s run up a white flag, then,&#8221; urged
Ned. &#8220;They ought to know what that means.
They&#8217;ll stop for that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In response to this suggestion the lads
quickly overhauled the flag locker finding just
what they sought. The white flag was at once
brought to the deck where it was bent on to
the halliards. It fluttered gaily at the top of
the short flagstaff. Some difficulty was experienced
in securing the staff because of an
improperly fitting socket.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do they seem to be making any change?&#8221;
inquired Harry presently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ned. &#8220;They&#8217;re crowding
on more sail!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we might as well give it up!&#8221; stated
the other. &#8220;They&#8217;ll never stop for us. Our
only hope is to dive and come up close to some
vessel so they can&#8217;t get away before we ask
the questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that would be a good idea,&#8221; admitted
Ned. &#8220;Anyhow, we&#8217;ll have to take down
this flag. The signal staff don&#8217;t fit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Disappointed because their efforts had been
unavailing, the lads regretfully folded the flag.
It was restored to its proper place.
</p>
<p>Harry, however, continued to urge the engines
forward in the hope of eventually overhauling
the ship. This seemed to be within
the range of possibilities, but the boys all knew
the maxim concerning a stern chase, and were
somewhat discouraged. Knowing that their
intentions were of the best, they felt slightly
aggrieved that the other did not stop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a smoke away ahead of the ship!&#8221; announced
Frank after a few moments. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
tell which way they are headed, though!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At this rate of traveling, we&#8217;ll soon find
out!&#8221; declared Jack.
</p>
<p>Evidently the smoke had been discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
by those aboard the sailing vessel, for the
course was altered slightly in that direction.
</p>
<p>This change was noted by the boys. Jimmie
shifted the helm slightly in order to keep
the submarine directly in the track of the ship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what that other vessel can be,&#8221;
puzzled Ned. &#8220;Let me take the glasses a moment,
Frank. I wish we were higher in the
water,&#8221; he added, &#8220;then we could get a better
range of vision.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Long and earnestly the boy inspected the
strange vessel. Presently he returned the
glasses to Frank with a sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Jack with keen interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is a warship of some sort!&#8221; replied
Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they&#8217;ll capture us and take us to port
mighty quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they&#8217;ll capture us all right!&#8221; put
in Frank. &#8220;I can see the sailing vessel making
signals. They&#8217;ve got a string of flags flying
from the foretopmast head. I don&#8217;t know
what they mean, but they&#8217;re calls for help,
or I&#8217;ll miss my guess! They are something
like the U. S. flags!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Those on board the steamer had evidently
seen the string of flags or else by the peculiar
actions of the sailing vessel guessed that something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
was wrong, for the boys saw that their
course was at once altered. From the clouds
of dense black smoke pouring from the funnels
they knew that the stokers were being
urged to their best efforts.
</p>
<p>In a short space of time the combined speeds
of the two vessels brought them close together.
As the other approached, Harry shut off the
power of the engines, checking them to little
more than steerageway.
</p>
<p>As the steamer passed the ship Ned could
see that some communication had been made
between the two. The steamer came quickly on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass me up that white flag again, Harry,&#8221;
requested Ned. &#8220;I think they&#8217;re coming up
to speak to us, and I&#8217;d just as soon have that
handy. Maybe these fellows might misunderstand
our motives, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish now I hadn&#8217;t painted that &#8216;U-13&#8217;
quite so plainly on the sides!&#8221; grumbled Jimmie.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet they&#8217;ve seen that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, they&#8217;ve seen it, but if we show
a white flag they won&#8217;t do anything to us.
They&#8217;ll let us ask questions!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In answer to this statement, a shot echoed
across the water. A ball striking the crest of
a wave sent a cloud of spray over the &#8220;U-13.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Get down that hatchway!&#8221; ordered Ned,
wiping the spray from his face. &#8220;Those fellows
see the name &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t they observe the white flag if we
put it up?&#8221; asked Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they will!&#8221; Ned stated.
&#8220;Better get below!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As if to emphasize the boy&#8217;s opinion another
report echoed over the space of water separating
the battleship from the new &#8220;U-13.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This time the shell had been aimed a trifle
too high. It went directly over the lads on the
diminutive deck. Instinctively they all ducked
their heads as the missile screamed wickedly
in its useless flight.
</p>
<p>If anything was needed to decide the matter,
this last offering seemed to serve the purpose.
All three lads hastened down the ladder
without further parley. Ned lingered a
moment to close the hatch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang onto your hats!&#8221; cried Jimmie the
next instant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get down quick!&#8221; urged Jack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
&#8220;Those fellows up there seem to mean business.
My stars!&#8221; he added breathlessly, &#8220;that
last one was certainly a beauty! They are getting
the range, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Already Harry had started the pumps, filling
the ballast tanks with water to assist the
&#8220;U-13&#8221; in the evolution of the dive. The rudders
were deflected to their extreme range.
With decks inclined to an alarming angle, the
submarine fled toward the bottom like a hunted
creature. Until the gauges showed a
depth of twelve fathoms, Jimmie held the levers
in position. Then he brought the craft to
an even keel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain to be seen that we&#8217;ll not get much
help from any ship on the North Sea!&#8221; declared
Jack at length, as the ballast tanks were
found to trim the vessel. &#8220;They&#8217;re scared of
us, I believe!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t any reason to be scared of
us!&#8221; stoutly protested Jimmie. &#8220;We have
never done a thing to them. We&#8217;re absolutely
neutral!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to be one thing to be neutral,&#8221;
laughed Ned, &#8220;and quite another thing to convince
other folks of the fact!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They might at least have given us a chance
to explain!&#8221; grumbled Jimmie. &#8220;We had a
white flag flying for them to see!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; argued Ned, &#8220;but did you stop to
think that we were showing ourselves in a
bad light? Remember the newspaper accounts
of all the damage done by a submarine? I&#8217;m
not surprised they ran away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then we come along in a submarine!
Of course, we couldn&#8217;t expect them to wait for
a German undersea craft to come popping out
of the ocean and waltz up alongside so they
could say: &#8216;Good morning, Mr. Dutchman!
Won&#8217;t you please accept this fine ship?&#8217;&#8221;
added Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m it!&#8221; declared Jimmie, joining in
the laugh that followed Jack&#8217;s facetious remark.
&#8220;The joke&#8217;s on me, all right! If I
hadn&#8217;t painted that figure &#8216;three&#8217; in the name,
we would have been on our way to England
by this time! Oh, well,&#8221; the boy added, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
get to England before long, anyhow, so I
should worry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It all shows, boys,&#8221; spoke up Ned, &#8220;that
we&#8217;ve got to be mighty careful about our appearance
and the company we keep. We have
gotten into this scrape largely because we were
found in possession of goods we had no business
to have. This last incident came about
because we pretended to be something we were
not!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that ought to be a good lesson to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
us,&#8221; stated Jimmie. &#8220;It will be for me, I
know! I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll take it to heart!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad we&#8217;re away from that inquisitive
gunboat!&#8221; put in Frank. &#8220;Now,
what&#8217;s the next thing for us to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I move that we keep below the surface
for a while. If we hold on a general southeasterly
course, as has been suggested, we
can&#8217;t fail to bring up somewhere on the English
coast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like the most reasonable
plan,&#8221; agreed Frank. &#8220;I propose that we put
on speed and hurry along. Let&#8217;s get somewhere!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we go!&#8221; cried Harry, increasing the
speed with a touch on the levers. &#8220;Let&#8217;s keep
a sharp lookout, though!&#8221;
</p>
<p>About half past three o&#8217;clock the boys decided
to rise to the surface for the necessary
airing of the vessel and storing of another supply
of fresh air in the tanks provided for that
purpose.
</p>
<p>In furtherance of this plan, the rudders were
shifted while Harry slowed the engines. Directly
the craft ascended. The gauges indicated
a depth of about eight fathoms when
Jimmie, who was at the helm, requested that
the rudders be again deflected.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; questioned Ned, stepping
forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see the light reflected down through
the water, and there&#8217;s a big shadow up there!&#8221;
declared Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think it can be?&#8221; asked Ned
wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably it&#8217;s a big vessel of some sort. It
may be a war ship, or it may be only a cargo
carrier. In either event I don&#8217;t want to get
tangled up in the propellers. Let&#8217;s sheer off
a bit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Ned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the
periscope. Maybe I can find out something
as we rise slowly to the surface.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cautiously creeping nearer the surface, the
lads put the periscope into action. By its
aid Ned made out that the craft was an armed
vessel. The new &#8220;U-13&#8221; lay just submerged
about a ship&#8217;s length to starboard of the
stranger. They maintained about the same
speed.
</p>
<p>Ned declared that he could make out the
British flag at the stern of the other vessel.
He stated that he could also notice a number
of people aboard the steamer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you see what they look like?&#8221; asked
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are regular sailors and marines,&#8221; answered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
Ned. &#8220;Why,&#8221; went on the lad excitedly,
&#8220;that looks like Mackinder at the rail!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Curiously the others crowded about the object
glass of the periscope. Each declared in
turn that they recognized Mackinder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I wonder what he&#8217;s doing aboard that
vessel!&#8221; mused Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite likely this ship met the fishing boat
and took him off so as to save the other the
trouble of going clear back to England!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt that&#8217;s it,&#8221; agreed Jack. &#8220;But
look!&#8221; he continued, &#8220;he&#8217;s discovered us! See
him pointing toward us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better get ready to dive, then,&#8221; cautioned
Harry. &#8220;If he&#8217;s able, he&#8217;ll get them to shoot
at us. If they hit the &#8216;U-13&#8217; it&#8217;ll be a long way
to Tipperary for us! We don&#8217;t know how
thick this armor is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Down we go!&#8221; shouted Jimmie, seizing the
wheel. &#8220;Lively, now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even as the boy spoke, a muffled roar was
distinctly heard by the lads in the submarine.
A crash that reverberated through every portion
of the vessel told that they had been hit
by a projectile.
</p>
<p>With a quick, startled glance at his companions,
Ned hastened aft to examine the possible
damage. He could discover no leak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re lucky, after all!&#8221; he stated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
presently. &#8220;We&#8217;re not taking in water, so I&#8217;m
sure they didn&#8217;t do very much damage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been more serious, though!&#8221;
commented Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the shot just carried away some
of the light work like railings and so on around
the deck. I don&#8217;t think the shot struck the
hull, or we&#8217;d have heard more racket,&#8221; went
on Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s keep below the surface for a while.
Maybe we can get away from those fellows
far enough to be out of their sight while we
change air. They&#8217;re not the least bit sociable!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Full speed ahead, Harry!&#8221; cried Frank.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s hurry on!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better take it easy,&#8221; cautioned Jimmie.
&#8220;We may not be out of the woods yet. Let&#8217;s
just go along slowly for a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, go on!&#8221; scorned Frank. &#8220;What&#8217;s
there out here to bother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; chimed in Jack. &#8220;We&#8217;re away out
in the North Sea where we can find nothing
but warships and sailing vessels and such!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we might run into the real &#8216;U-13&#8217;,&#8221;
countered Jimmie. &#8220;Then, what would you do
if you should meet that fellow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, put on steam and run away from
him, of course!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right, go ahead if you want to,&#8221; submitted
Jimmie unwillingly, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think
it wise. It&#8217;s taking considerable risk!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Since the majority seemed to be in favor of
more speed, the engines were again urged to
greater effort. Suddenly all were startled by
a cry from Jimmie. The boat swerved sharply
to starboard, rolling until the deck was at
an acute angle. Harry reached for the levers,
prepared to stand by the engines for orders
from the pilot.
</p>
<p>Directly Jimmie rang a stop bell. The vessel
came again to an even keel. The boys were
once more able to stand upright.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Jimmie?&#8221; cried Ned, as
he scrambled to his feet. &#8220;Is it a whale, or did
you nearly have a collision?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Collision is exactly the word!&#8221; declared
the other. &#8220;I saw the masts of a ship standing
right in our path. I got this little craft turned
just in time! That&#8217;s what we get for blundering
along so fast!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a ship is it?&#8221; asked Frank,
peering from one porthole after another. &#8220;Are
you sure it was the mast of a vessel?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly, I am sure!&#8221; was Jimmie&#8217;s
decisive answer. &#8220;Don&#8217;t I know a ship&#8217;s
masts? I surely do!&#8221; the lad answered his
own question.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s swing around and see what it was,&#8221;
proposed Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, turn the deflecting rudders and
down we go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Swinging in a broad circle, the submarine
was directed downward to a level equal with
that of the hull of the ship, whose masts had
so nearly proven disastrous to the boys. As
the craft sank deeper the crew watched with
a great deal of curiosity from the thick glasses
over the portholes. Carefully they studied
every detail of rig.
</p>
<p>Although the sunshine penetrated to some
distance below the surface, they found that
at the depth where the hull lay a semi-twilight
prevailed. The upper portions of the masts
had been clearly visible, but the decks lay
in a haze that prevented their seeing well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like the ship is almost new!&#8221; stated
Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly it has been sunk only a short
time,&#8221; ventured Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you make out what ship it is?&#8221; asked
Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute until we pass the stern
again,&#8221; said Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see it!&#8221; declared Harry in a moment.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the Wanderer of Sydney! That
will be an Australian vessel!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And that great gap in the port side indicates
that the sinking was the work of our
namesake!&#8221; stated Ned. &#8220;This is another victim
of the German &#8216;U-13&#8217;. Probably it is only
one of many!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder the other fellows don&#8217;t seem
inclined to be any too sociable!&#8221; said Jack.
&#8220;They really cannot be blamed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Jack,&#8221; responded Ned.
&#8220;When anyone hits at the pocketbook we&#8217;re
apt to consider everybody under suspicion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get closer and examine the damage
done by the torpedo,&#8221; suggested Frank. &#8220;I&#8217;d
like to observe the effects of the attack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Shortly the misnamed &#8220;U-13&#8221; was creeping
alongside the hull of the sunken vessel. Jimmie
handled the wheel dexterously, ever alert
for possible danger. Harry stood by the engines,
ready at a moment&#8217;s notice to assist in
executing any maneuver desired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks as if the whole side of the ship had
been torn away,&#8221; stated Ned, as the submarine
crept slowly past the jagged wound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those torpedoes surely are powerful,&#8221;
agreed Frank. &#8220;I hope everybody got away
from the ship before the explosion took place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They probably gave the crew plenty of
time to escape if this is the work of the
&#8216;U-13&#8217;,&#8221; commented Ned. &#8220;You say they gave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
the crew on your vessel ample time to get
safely away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but the men let themselves become
panic-stricken. They lost their heads and consumed
a good deal of time. Besides that, they
forgot they were civilized. One of them hit
me an awful clip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And pretty nearly left you on board to be
drowned!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These fellows did the same thing!&#8221; announced
Jack, peering out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did what?&#8221; queried Ned, wondering what
the other meant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Left a man aboard when the ship sank,&#8221;
stated Jack, pointing through the little port
hole. &#8220;There he is, walking about!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clearly the boys saw a figure apparently
crossing the deck.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>ALONE AND HELPLESS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Good night!&#8221; almost shrieked Frank.
&#8220;That&#8217;s uncanny! Whoever heard of a man
walking about at the bottom of the ocean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he come from, Jack?&#8221; asked
Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw that figure come out of the companionway,&#8221;
stated Jack. &#8220;I thought I was mistaken
at first, because of the dim light. I
looked again as you boys were talking. Then
I saw that it was the figure of a man, apparently.
He seems to be carrying something in
his arms!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There he goes over the side of the vessel!&#8221;
whispered Harry in an awestruck voice.
&#8220;What sort of deal is this, anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you notice the knapsack thing he was
wearing on his back?&#8221; asked Frank. &#8220;If I
was superstitious, I&#8217;d say it was the ghost of
a soldier who had been drowned and was seeking
his way back home!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t take any stock in that ghost business!&#8221;
declared Ned stoutly. &#8220;Some things
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
may look supernatural because we don&#8217;t understand
them, but there&#8217;s always an explanation
if we seek it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your explanation of this thing,
Ned?&#8221; questioned Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably some mass of seaweed or some
other substance got caught in a current and
lodged against the cabin on the Wanderer.
When we circled about the wreck we set up
counter currents that may have released this
mass. It then floated along in the current to
finally sink on the other side of this submerged
hull. That&#8217;s all there is to it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what sort of a current is bringing
the bloomin&#8217; thing back again!&#8221; announced
Jack as Ned concluded his explanation. &#8220;It&#8217;s
moving its lower edges most remarkably like a
man walking!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ned&#8217;s look of bewilderment increased.
Clearly the boy was puzzled. Even he, himself,
was not quite satisfied with the explanation
of the strange sight which had greeted the
boys.
</p>
<p>Slowly forging ahead, the submarine passed
toward the stern of the Wanderer, shutting
the strange figure out of sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn around the stern again, Jimmie,&#8221; requested
Ned. &#8220;Go easy on the engines, and
we&#8217;ll have a look from a new angle. This is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
getting rather spooky, I must say. I want to
examine into it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the false &#8220;U-13&#8221; rounded the stern
of the wreck. Slowly the craft nosed along
the port side to a point abreast the mizzen
chains. Directly at a signal from the pilot,
Harry shut off power altogether.
</p>
<p>The strange magnetism that seems to exist
in all objects at sea slowly drew the submarine
toward the ship. Its drift had been sufficient
to bring the vessel to a point abreast the main
rigging before it stopped.
</p>
<p>By this time the craft had approached close
to the wreck. A very slight jar told the boys
that their vessel had touched the other. Eagerly
all watched from the portholes, now but
a short space above the level of the rail across
which they looked. Directly all was still. At
this depth, no movement of water was discernible.
</p>
<p>Feeling awed by the strangeness of the situation,
the boys refrained from speech. They
watched for the reappearance of the strange
figure.
</p>
<p>Soon Jimmie hissed a warning. He reached
out a hand to turn the switch controlling the
lights. The boat lay in utter darkness.
</p>
<p>A figure stepped out of the Wanderer&#8217;s companionway.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>It appeared to be that of a person of medium
build. The boys could now see that it was
clothed in what seemed to be a diver&#8217;s suit.
The helmet, however, was not connected to any
air pipe. Neither was there a line leading
upward to indicate the presence of assistance.
A hump on the shoulders, giving the impression
of a knapsack, afforded much wonderment
and increased the mysterious look of the newcomer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh-h-h!&#8221; warned Ned in a sibilant hiss, as
the figure came directly toward their position.
&#8220;Keep quiet!&#8221; he whispered.
</p>
<p>A few steps carried the stranger to the rail.
The boys saw him give a start of amazement
as he prepared to go over the side of the ship.
Clearly the strange diver was surprised to see
the craft in that position. He stepped back
a pace, then came gingerly forward.
</p>
<p>Evidently the man was astonished to observe
the &#8220;U-13&#8221;. He climbed slowly into the
main shrouds. From that position he surveyed
the craft more completely. Again he
returned to the deck.
</p>
<p>During this examination the lads had remained
quietly at their posts, not caring to
make their presence known until they were
sure of the identity of the other. They still
remained with their faces at the portholes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
where they observed, so far as possible, every
move of the stranger.
</p>
<p>Directly they observed the diver pick up
the burden he had brought from the cabin. He
hastened to the rail of the wreck. In a moment
he had clambered overboard, letting himself
down by means of a line secured to a belaying
pin at the mainmast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny!&#8221; observed Ned, as the other
disappeared from view. &#8220;What do you suppose
made him scuttle out of sight so hurriedly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he, like the warship, saw our name&mdash;&#8216;U-13&#8217;&mdash;on
the side of the vessel!&#8221; ventured
Jimmie. &#8220;They all run away from that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It surely doesn&#8217;t make us many friends!&#8221;
declared Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right!&#8221; answered the other. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the original killjoy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s dive a little deeper,&#8221; suggested Jack.
&#8220;Perhaps we can find out where this new
chap is going with those bundles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;ll find out how he got here!&#8221;
added Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And while you fellows are &#8216;perhapsing&#8217;,&#8221;
put in Jimmie, &#8220;I&#8217;ll say that perhaps we&#8217;d better
stick out! Perhaps he doesn&#8217;t want us nosing
around his property, and perhaps he&#8217;ll
touch off a bomb!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you lately?&#8221; inquired
Frank. &#8220;You&#8217;re getting to be a regular
little &#8216;fraid-cat&#8217;! You never used to be
so timid about sticking your nose into other
people&#8217;s business!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid to go looking into things
now, only I&#8217;ve got a hunch that we&#8217;d better
not do it, that&#8217;s all!&#8221; answered the lad. &#8220;Just
because I happen to want to leave a fellow
alone is no sign I&#8217;m a &#8216;fraid-cat&#8217;. If you lads
want to go anywhere, you tell me the name of
the place. I&#8217;m game to stick with you until
they turn out the lights!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Spoken like a man, Jimmie!&#8221; declared
Frank. &#8220;That sounds like the old Jimmie
we used to know. Now, let&#8217;s go down a
ways.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry sprang to the levers. A few shifts
of the control brought the storage batteries to
work operating the pumps. With the additional
water admitted by this process, the false
&#8220;U-13&#8221; sank until far below the level of the
rail of the wreck. Still deeper and deeper it
settled.
</p>
<p>Presently the boys at the port holes could
discover the bends of the sides, indicating that
they were nearly to the ocean floor. In another
moment a slight bump told them that the
craft rested on bottom.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a flash of light just now!&#8221; stated
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did it come from?&#8221; asked Ned,
stepping forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just ahead of us on this side of the ship.
The shadow lies heavily there, so I can&#8217;t make
out what&#8217;s located in that place!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys had not long to wait, however, to
discover the cause of the flash which Jimmie
had seen. Almost following the boy&#8217;s words
came a dazzling beam of light, piercing the
dark shadow like an arrow. For a moment
the boys were blinded as the searchlight&#8217;s
flame played on the forward part of their vessel.
</p>
<p>Presently the light shifted. It was turned
against the side of the sunken Wanderer. Up
and down the light traveled, revealing the
rugged sides of the hull, with its covering of
barnacles below what had been the water line.
Outward the beam went, showing nothing but
ocean floor. Fishes were illuminated and dazzled
by the strong ray.
</p>
<p>Finally the light returned to the false
&#8220;U-13&#8221;, where it settled for a moment. Directly
the light was turned off.
</p>
<p>Jimmie had been shading his eyes with a
protecting hand. He was, therefore, not so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
much blinded by the glare as the others had
been.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There they go!&#8221; he cried, as the light
was removed from the port hole through which
it had been shining. &#8220;They&#8217;re rising!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can it be, I wonder?&#8221; questioned Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never tell you!&#8221; declared Jimmie. &#8220;Oh,
yes, I will, too!&#8221; he amended his statement.
&#8220;If you want to know, it&#8217;s the &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;U-13&#8217;?&#8221; questioned the lads in chorus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221; positively stated Jimmie.
&#8220;Here,&#8221; he cried, turning a switch leading to
the searchlight. &#8220;Take a look!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The powerful storage batteries on the vessel
occupied by the boys generated a ray of light
that pierced the darkness of the undersea
world with ease. Sharply outlined in the circle
of flame the lads clearly saw the form of a
submarine vessel similar in many respects to
their own. There was the same sharp prow,
the same tapering stern with conning tower,
keel, port lights, and every essential feature
of the vessel upon which they were located.
</p>
<p>Outlined upon the side, in letters fully the
same size as those upon their own vessel, the
lads saw distinctly the mark &#8220;U-13.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about that?&#8221; gasped
Frank. &#8220;That&#8217;s fierce!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is it the same vessel you saw off Land&#8217;s
End, Frank?&#8221; asked Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t say,&#8221; returned the other.
&#8220;I think it is! Of course, we&#8217;re somewhat below
it. Besides the difference in perspective
from this angle the water has a great deal to
do with changing the appearance of everything.
The general outlines appear similar,
however.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re in a ticklish position!&#8221; declared
Ned. &#8220;Suppose those fellows take it
into their head to torpedo us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do,&#8221; stated Frank decisively,
&#8220;they&#8217;ll play havoc!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going over the wreck!&#8221; stated
Jimmie in a whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s rise a little and see which way they
head for,&#8221; proposed Frank. &#8220;We can then go
in the opposite direction for a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better slide right along to
the southwest,&#8221; stated Jimmie. &#8220;I know I&#8217;m
meeting a good deal of opposition, but I&#8217;ve a
hunch that we&#8217;ll be better off if we get right
away from this spot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Been reading that dream book again, little
man?&#8221; asked Ned, with a laugh. &#8220;Sorry,
Jimmie, but the majority seems to be against
you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Boss!&#8221; returned Jimmie with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m game to stick with the bunch!
You&#8217;ll find me right here smiling all the
while!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie,&#8221; gravely stated Ned, &#8220;I wish we
could all get some of that sunny disposition
of yours. We need a lot of your optimism.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; was Jimmie&#8217;s reply, delivered
with an excess of politeness. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;m at
the wheel, Captain. Where to, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s rise first and see what the other is
doing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ding, ding!&#8221; cried Jimmie. &#8220;Touch up
the mule, Harry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry&#8217;s manipulations of the levers brought
the false &#8220;U-13&#8221; rapidly to a level with the
Wanderer&#8217;s deck. Through the port lights
the boys could see the other submarine across
the sunken ship. It seemed to be gradually
descending toward the bottom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s follow them and see where they go!&#8221;
proposed Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At your service, sir!&#8221; cried Jimmie, saluting.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll proceed to proceed!&#8221; he added
with a grin. &#8220;Here goes after the real
&#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead slowly, Harry,&#8221; cautioned Ned.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to overtake them yet. We&#8217;re
in the shadow here, so they probably won&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
see us if we hang back a little. Just give
the wheel a little kick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Slowly the vessel carried the boys over the
sunken Australian. They were passing between
the main and mizzen rigging at a level
slightly lower than that of the main yard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that just ahead of us?&#8221; queried
Jack, at the porthole.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything,&#8221; replied Ned.
&#8220;What and where is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right here,&#8221; declared Jack, pointing.
&#8220;No, you&#8217;re too late! I thought it looked like
a snake in the water at first, but I see it was
only a piece of rope hanging from the rigging.
It&#8217;s all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly it has been hanging down all the
time but the current caused by the passage of
the other vessel swung it outward,&#8221; ventured
Ned. &#8220;It will no doubt slip past in a moment!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But this prediction was not fulfilled. With
a sudden lurch, the stern of the false &#8220;U-13&#8221;
rose, tilting the deck sharply forward.
</p>
<p>With a groan the propellers stopped.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>HELP FROM A STRANGER</h3>
</div>

<p>Harry uttered a sharp cry as he stumbled
forward along the steep incline of the floor. It
seemed as if some huge power had grasped
the stern of the craft, raising it until the vessel
tilted forward at an angle which rendered
walking impossible.
</p>
<p>All the boys were thrown toward the forward
end of the vessel, where Jimmie was located.
Ned and Jack lost their footing. They
rolled awkwardly to the forward bulkhead.
Harry and Frank managed to remain upright
by hurriedly grasping at parts of the machinery
or at stanchions. Their progress was undignified
as well as sudden.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; sharply questioned Jimmie,
regaining his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The stern&#8217;s up!&#8221; facetiously replied Jack,
also struggling to a standing position. &#8220;Is
anybody hurt?&#8221; the boy continued.
</p>
<p>A brief examination disclosed the fact that
beyond a few minor bruises none of the boys
had been seriously injured. Their first care
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
was for each other. All were glad to find no
one badly hurt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth can have happened to us?&#8221;
asked Ned, peering from a port light on the
starboard side. &#8220;Did we collide with something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we did,&#8221; returned Harry.
&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any bump as if we&#8217;d run into
another object. We just stopped!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then the stern went up into the air
and stayed there!&#8221; put in Jack. &#8220;Something&#8217;s
got us by the stern and won&#8217;t let go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I know what it is!&#8221; announced
Frank. &#8220;What is it they call these fishermen
with a big net dragging around?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fishermen!&#8221; answered Jimmie, with a
grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop your nonsense!&#8221; ordered Frank, administering
a friendly punch to his red-headed
comrade. &#8220;I mean the fellows with a big drag
net!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trawlers is the word you want, Frank!&#8221;
said Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; agreed Frank. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet we&#8217;re
tangled in one of their nets. Maybe we can&#8217;t
get loose again, either,&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it!&#8221; scorned Jimmie. &#8220;If
it was a fisherman had hold of us, we&#8217;d be
yanked around pretty lively. I think it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
that rope we saw hanging in front of the port
light!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re right, Jimmie!&#8221; Ned put
in as he gazed through the heavy glass on the
port side. &#8220;I can see that we&#8217;re swinging
close to the mainmast. There is no motion
to the boat, so that makes me think your solution
is about right. Now to get loose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I agree with you!&#8221; stated Harry.
&#8220;But how? If your assumption is correct,
we&#8217;ve got a big piece of line wound around
the outboard end of the shaft. It is probably
more or less tangled up in the propeller
also. We can&#8217;t turn the engines over!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we could throw out the clutch and
turn the shaft backwards enough to unwind
the line!&#8221; suggested Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in favor of rising to the surface if the
slack of line will permit,&#8221; offered Jack. &#8220;We
could then open the hatchway. It would be
easy enough from there to clear the line from
the screw.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s probably the best way out of it,&#8221;
commented Ned. &#8220;Suppose we try that.
Harry, can we rise as Jack suggests?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; came Harry&#8217;s hesitating
reply. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Accordingly the boy clambered from his position
near the forward bulkhead to the compartment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
amidships, where the pumps were
located. A shift of valves followed by a touch
on the levers connecting the storage batteries
with the electric pumps started the process of
emptying the ballast tanks.
</p>
<p>Almost instantly the forward end of the
craft began to rise. Very shortly the deck was
in a level position. Then, as Harry continued
to empty the water ballast, Frank and Ned,
assisted by Jimmie and Jack, threw the clutch
on the propeller shaft out of contact in order
to permit the tail shaft to turn without moving
the engines.
</p>
<p>They then endeavored to turn the portion
of the shaft which projected through the stern
bearing in the back up motion to free the
propeller. They hoped thus to release the
rope which they believed to be wound around
the outboard portion of the shaft.
</p>
<p>Strive as they might, however, the shaft
stubbornly refused to move. Their utmost
efforts were unavailing.
</p>
<p>At length, out of breath and exhausted, Ned
sank back upon a locker. He looked at his
companions with a curious expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Ned?&#8221; inquired Jack
anxiously. &#8220;Are you ill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel badly, boys,&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;Unless
we can devise some means to free that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
line from the shaft, we are in a pretty tight
fix!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How near the surface can you bring the
boat, Harry?&#8221; asked Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The gauges show that we&#8217;re about two and
a half fathoms down at present,&#8221; replied
Harry. &#8220;I have pumped a lot more water out
than would ordinarily be required to bring us
to the surface.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we must be held by that line!&#8221; declared
Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s try some other maneuver with the
ship before we give up!&#8221; put in Jack. &#8220;We&#8217;re
not half though our experiments yet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, what&#8217;ll you try?&#8221; asked Ned in
a despairing tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;But we&#8217;re
going to do something to help get us out of
this fix. How would it do to fill the tanks
to sink us as far as we can go? Then we could
empty them in a hurry, which would make
the boat rise swiftly. The jounce would perhaps
break the line and let us up so we could
get some fresh air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t get some fresh air pretty soon,
we&#8217;ll have to do something desperate. The
reserve tank is nearly exhausted!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In compliance with Jack&#8217;s suggestion, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
ballast tanks were again filled. Gradually the
&#8220;U-13&#8221; descended to the bottom. As the
deck began to tilt forward, as it had done
when the craft was first stopped, Harry threw
into operation every pump that could be used
to empty the water from the ballast tanks. The
boat rose rapidly.
</p>
<p>With a jerk that nearly threw the boys off
their feet, the &#8220;U-13&#8221; came to a rest. The
gauges still showed the same depth as before.
</p>
<p>Ned&#8217;s face turned ashen as he sank upon a
locker. The others gathered around him, expressing
sympathy. The boy was clearly distressed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Ned!&#8221; spoke up Frank.
&#8220;We&#8217;re coming out all right! The only trouble
is that we haven&#8217;t tried the right thing yet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t seem to think of a thing to do
in this case,&#8221; protested the other. &#8220;I&#8217;m all
out of ideas! I&#8217;m sorry that we tried to follow
that other submarine. I wish we had taken
Jimmie&#8217;s advice!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that now, Ned. We&#8217;re close
to the surface. If it becomes necessary, I will
volunteer to be shot out of the torpedo tube.
I can rise to the surface, swim about until
I get my wind again, and then dive and cut
the rope. That will release the whole ship!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie, that&#8217;s awfully good of you to offer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
that, but I feel that I should be the one to
do it,&#8221; was Ned&#8217;s reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; declared Jimmie promptly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re in no condition to attempt anything
like that. You&#8217;re worried, and your heart action
is not right just now. My mind is a blank,
and my heart is as sound as a bullet! I&#8217;m
just the one for the job!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As if the matter were understood, Jimmie
began divesting himself of his clothing. He
deposited his jacket on the locker beside Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; he said, turning to his chum,
&#8220;will you see that the torpedo tube is connected
up and in working order? You might
try a discharge for practice. We can spare
a little of this air!&#8221;
</p>
<p>By the time Jimmie had stripped and secured
a knife to a belt about his waist, Harry
pronounced the tube ready for operation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, fellows,&#8221; said Jimmie, shaking hands
with his chums, &#8220;there&#8217;s about one chance in
a million that I won&#8217;t get through this all
right. If you are not up to the surface in five
minutes, you may know that I&#8217;ve failed. Then
you&#8217;d better send out another lad!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me next!&#8221; shouted Jack, beginning to remove
his shoes.
</p>
<p>Harry was peering from the heavy glass
protecting the forward porthole. As Jimmie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
stepped forward to enter the torpedo tube,
Harry held up a warning hand. He turned
an anxious face to his friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something outside here!&#8221; he announced
in an anxious tone. &#8220;I saw it once,
but didn&#8217;t get a clear view!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did it look like?&#8221; asked Jimmie.
&#8220;Is it alive?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure, but I think it&#8217;s another submarine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably the real &#8216;U-13&#8217; come up to look
us over. Never mind those fellows. I&#8217;m going
ahead and cut this wagon loose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;I see the
craft over here to starboard. It&#8217;s a peculiar
vessel, too! I think I see a man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see him, too!&#8221; declared Frank from a
porthole a short distance aft. &#8220;Do you suppose
he&#8217;s trying to get us to descend again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s it! Let&#8217;s try it, anyway!&#8221;
offered Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; agreed Ned in a tone that
showed he was again taking heart. &#8220;Let&#8217;s act
on the suggestion. We can try our scheme
later!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry&#8217;s hand had already found the levers.
In a moment the ballast tanks were being filled
with water. Gradually the vessel sank.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>As the light grew more dim at the increased
depth, Jimmie declared he could see the other
vessel descending at about the same speed.
</p>
<p>Presently the two craft were at the limit of
their travel. The visitor rested on the deck
of the Wanderer, while the &#8216;U-13&#8217;, in which
the boys were imprisoned, hung again at an
angle from the line.
</p>
<p>Directly the lads saw the figure that had
formerly attracted their attention. It was
climbing the main shrouds of the wrecked
ship. When the man reached a position level
with their craft he began making signs and
motions. In his hand he flourished a knife.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks rather bad for us!&#8221; commented
Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you get him?&#8221; asked Jimmie impatiently.
&#8220;He understands our predicament
and intends to help us! He motioned out that
he is going to climb the rigging until he can
find the rope. Then he&#8217;ll slide down it until
he lands on our stern. If we&#8217;ll agree not to
start the engines while he&#8217;s there, he&#8217;ll cut
the rope. But we must be ready at the ballast
tanks to let the vessel settle slowly to the
deck of the ship, so he can get off and clear
the line from the propeller!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; stated Jack. &#8220;I think
he meant to cut the line as soon as he gets to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
it and let us settle down slowly. What would
be the sense of his riding around the ocean
seated on the stern of a disabled submarine?
He&#8217;s got too much sense for that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right!&#8221; admitted Jimmie.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s float the boat on an even keel and see.
I&#8217;m going to dress again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even as the lad hastened to put on his
clothes the boys felt a sudden dip made by the
submarine. Gradually they descended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah, he did it!&#8221; exultantly cried Ned.
&#8220;Now, where has he gone? I do hope he&#8217;ll free
the propeller wheel at once!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We could rise to the surface even if the
propeller is stuck!&#8221; declared Harry. &#8220;I can
pump the ballast all out of the tanks!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we do that we&#8217;ll have to dive overboard
to clear the wheel!&#8221; protested Frank.
&#8220;I know that water is good and cold!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, boys, and see what the
fellow does,&#8221; cautioned Ned. &#8220;Maybe he
wants to help us, so it wouldn&#8217;t be nice to run
away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he is, now!&#8221; cried Jack from his
position near a porthole. &#8220;He&#8217;s looking
through the glass, and making motions
again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what he wants!&#8221; declared Harry.
&#8220;He&#8217;s making motions for us to unscrew a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
pipe! He wants us to let in a lot of the
ocean!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Harry!&#8221; put in Ned. &#8220;He&#8217;s
walking toward his own boat. Let&#8217;s see what
he&#8217;s going to do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a short time their rescuer had reached
the side of his own vessel. He stepped into
an open door in the side and disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An air lock!&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;Did you see
that, boys?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like the little old Sea Lion we used
in the China Sea!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he comes again with a line!&#8221; announced
Harry. &#8220;Now what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys heard a hammering and thumping
near one of the sea cocks.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>MACKINDER AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Even as the five boys glanced at each other
with startled and wondering looks, the thumping
ceased abruptly. In a short space it was
resumed. Instinctively the boys gathered
near the spot.
</p>
<p>While they stood there trying to determine
the cause for the strange procedure, the noise
ceased. They heard a tapping at one of the
portholes. Jimmie rushed across the compartment
to investigate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, fellows, come over here a minute!&#8221; he
called out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you found now?&#8221; questioned
Ned, obeying the request.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s this chap, and he&#8217;s making all sorts
of signals!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny!&#8221; puzzled Ned. &#8220;Can you
make out what he wants?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s making his hands go in the strangest
way! I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t interpret such motions
unless he wants us to turn around while he
places a bomb or something close enough to
blow us out of the water.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know what he wants!&#8221; shouted Harry,
who had been closely observing the stranger&#8217;s
repetition of the strange motions. &#8220;He wants
us to open the valve leading from that sea
cock where he has been working!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine business!&#8221; scorned Jimmie. &#8220;Open
up the sea cock and let the ocean come running
all over our nice carpets! I guess not!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try it, anyway!&#8221; declared
Harry. &#8220;If a little water does come in, the
pumps will take care of it before it becomes
dangerous. At least, it&#8217;s well worth trying!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, then, but don&#8217;t blame me if
anything happens!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry moved to the vicinity of the spot
where the stranger had been occupied but
a few moments before. Jimmie was at the
porthole.
</p>
<p>A turn of the valve resulted in a sudden
short inrush of water.
</p>
<p>This ceased abruptly, bringing forth an exultant
cry from Harry, while the other boys
crowded around, speculating on the cause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221; cried Harry, dancing about
the compartment. &#8220;I know what he&#8217;s going
to do. Go to the porthole, Jimmie, and see
where our friend is now. Tell me just what
he&#8217;s doing. I&#8217;m going to stand guard over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
this valve here for a while in case something
happens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going back into his little cage!&#8221;
stated Jimmie from his position. &#8220;He&#8217;s just
shutting the outer door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand by to see something happen now,
boys!&#8221; announced Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going to happen, Harry?&#8221; asked
Jack.
</p>
<p>Before Harry could answer, a sputter of
water and air was observed at the open valve.
A small quantity of water was blown out of
the pipe. Following this came a rush of
sweet, pure air that was very grateful to the
boys after they had been using the vitiated atmosphere
of their craft.
</p>
<p>In fact, the lads were much nearer the complete
exhaustion of their supply of usable atmosphere
than they really comprehended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m-m!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmie, inhaling
great draughts of the incoming current.
&#8220;Smell that, will you? It&#8217;s just like a posy
bed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite remarkable!&#8221; declared Ned,
as he, too, sniffed the new atmosphere. &#8220;It
does really seem to carry the odor of flowers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a sort of gas that he&#8217;s unloading
on us to render us unconscious, so he can
capture the whole outfit!&#8221; conjectured Jack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; protested Ned. &#8220;I&#8217;m
quite convinced that this is pure air. He
seems to have quite a lot of it stored up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pump out some of this foul air and
change with the new!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; consented Ned. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good
move, I&#8217;m sure!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a short time the boys began to feel the
effects of the inflow of vitalized atmosphere.
They were livelier, with less depression.
</p>
<p>Directly their attention was attracted to the
porthole again by a tapping. The stranger
was once more trying to convey some information
by signs. He repeated the motions
of a short time before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got you!&#8221; cried Harry, holding up a hand
as a sign of understanding. &#8220;He wants us
to shut the valve off. Perhaps he&#8217;s given us
all the nice fresh air that he feels it possible to
spare!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut the valve, then,&#8221; directed Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221; spoke up Jimmie, listening
to a slight hammering outside of the hull.
&#8220;He&#8217;s disconnecting the pipe now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better wait a bit and see what he wants
us to do,&#8221; cautioned Ned. &#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s going
to cut the line out of our propeller.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad&#8217;s prediction was correct. In a very
few moments they could hear the stranger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
working away at the encumbering line which
held their propeller in a vise-like grip.
</p>
<p>Not many minutes passed before the
stranger again appeared at the porthole.
Making a few signals easily comprehended by
all, he repaired to his own craft, entering and
closing the door of the air lock.
</p>
<p>Almost immediately the other craft began
to ascend perpendicularly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we may as well make a mooch!&#8221;
stated Jimmie, as he watched the other submarine
rise out of their range of vision.
&#8220;We&#8217;re done here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, let&#8217;s get going!&#8221; agreed Harry,
stepping toward the levers and preparing to
start the motors at the pilot&#8217;s command.
</p>
<p>At once Jimmie sprang to the wheel. He
gave a pull at the bell cord, jangling out a
&#8220;go ahead&#8221; signal to Harry. As the latter
touched the levers a startling crash at the
stern of the craft was heard.
</p>
<p>The motors spun the shaft around futilely
without making headway.
</p>
<p>With blanched faces the lads glanced about
the craft. Harry&#8217;s hand instinctively sought
the levers again to turn off the current.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; called Jimmie from
his position.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; declared Harry. &#8220;It
sounded as if that fellow had tied a can to us
and we&#8217;d set it going! What did he do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pump the ballast out and rise
straight to the surface,&#8221; suggested Ned. &#8220;I
noticed that he did that. Maybe there&#8217;s a
reason!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry lost no time in acting on this suggestion.
The electric pumps were not long in
emptying the ballast tanks. With this weight
removed, the boat quickly shot upward to the
surface.
</p>
<p>As the conning tower portholes rose above
the surface, the boys noticed that the afternoon
was far spent. Darkness already was
gathering.
</p>
<p>Ned was working frantically at the clamps
securing the hatch cover. With a cry of delight
he swung the cover out of position, admitting
a cool breeze. The wind had died
down, leaving the surface of the ocean comparatively
smooth. Sufficient breeze was moving,
however, to serve the purpose of airing
out the interior of the craft without putting
the great fans into commission. All the boys
came to the tiny deck.
</p>
<p>Lying but a few fathoms from their port
side they discerned the other submarine.
Clearly distinguishable on the sides were the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
great letters &#8220;U-13&#8221; painted in almost exact
duplicate of those on their own boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about that?&#8221; was Jimmie&#8217;s
surprised exclamation. &#8220;If that fellow
isn&#8217;t a dead ringer for this ship, I&#8217;m a Dutchman!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He surely does look a whole lot like us!&#8221;
agreed Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Frank,&#8221; put in Harry eagerly, &#8220;is
that the fellow that sank the ship you were
on? Can you identify it now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Frank shook his head hesitatingly before
he answered slowly: &#8220;Boys, I hate to say it,
but it looks as like the other as two peas. I
would not like to make an affidavit, but I&#8217;m
willing to say that it bears a most remarkable
resemblance to that other one, if it is &#8216;other&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I guess we&#8217;re done for!&#8221; despaired
Jack. &#8220;If that&#8217;s a German craft, we may as
well hoist the white flag now and surrender!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think they&#8217;ll take us back to Germany?&#8221;
asked Ned quizzically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it!&#8221; declared the boy. &#8220;And
we won&#8217;t stand much show, either, when they
find that we&#8217;ve stolen this ship away from
Helgoland!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; exclaimed Ned suddenly. &#8220;I
declare I&#8217;d actually forgotten that we were on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
board a stolen submarine. That does make
it look rather dubious for us. We are in a
pretty mess!&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes someone now!&#8221; announced
Jimmie. &#8220;Watch the hatch!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A movement of the hatch cover on the other
vessel indicated that someone was about to appear
on deck. Slowly a figure stepped forth.
</p>
<p>The stranger was of medium build, and wore
a suit of blue with a round hat to match. He
was carefully dressed. After taking a long
survey of the group on the deck of the false
&#8220;U-13,&#8221; he waved a hand in welcome.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants us to come over and pay him a
visit!&#8221; stated Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you accept, then?&#8221; inquired
Ned. &#8220;We&#8217;re into it now and may as well
be sociable. Being balky won&#8217;t help matters
any!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would if we had a boat,&#8221; announced the
other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the real &#8216;U-13&#8217; there has a boat
they&#8217;d spare,&#8221; suggested Jack. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you hail and ask him if he won&#8217;t send a boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hail him yourself if you want to! Maybe
he don&#8217;t talk English!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try him on United States then!&#8221; laughed
Jack. &#8220;I would!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Help yourself!&#8221; said Jimmie, leaning back
against the rail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahoy the submarine!&#8221; shouted Jack in response
to this suggestion. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t a
boat or we&#8217;d come over. Can you send a boat
to us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Waving an arm as if comprehending the
lad&#8217;s statement and inquiry the figure on
the other vessel clambered quickly to the after
deck. After a moment&#8217;s fumbling at what appeared
to be a lock, he lifted a cover. In a
short time the boys saw him drag from its
place a small, light, steel boat.
</p>
<p>This was at once launched over the side.
Running out upon a light iron ladder the man
dropped into the rowboat. He sculled the
small craft quickly over the intervening distance
and was soon alongside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come aboard, sir,&#8221; invited Ned, reaching
out a hand to assist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night!&#8221; ejaculated Jimmie. &#8220;How
did you ever get here so quickly, Mackinder?
We thought you were aboard that warship!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here a long time!&#8221; laughed the
other, looking at the lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made a quick trip, all right!&#8221; returned
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>The others crowded forward with eager,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
questioning looks. Upon the face of each was
to be seen amazement, wonder and perplexity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come aboard, Mackinder,&#8221; invited Ned.
&#8220;We&#8217;d like to hear an explanation of the
strange goings on hereabouts. Can you help
us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;First, I&#8217;d like to hear your explanations,&#8221;
stated the newcomer. &#8220;But before you start
your story, please tell me why you call me
Mackinder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that your name?&#8221; asked Jimmie.
&#8220;Tell us that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s my name, you know!&#8221; replied
the stranger, smilingly. &#8220;But how did you
happen to know it? I&#8217;m rather puzzled, you
know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you told us yourself on the train
running into Amsterdam!&#8221; stated Jimmie,
with rising indignation. &#8220;Then we called you
by that name while you were trying to delay
our start. Also Captain von Kluck used that
name when he referred to you. I guess it&#8217;s
your name all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t deny that!&#8221; stated the newcomer.
&#8220;What puzzles me is how you chaps know it
so quickly, don&#8217;t you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t make much difference how we
know the name so quickly,&#8221; went on Jimmie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
&#8220;We&#8217;d know you anywhere we saw you. We&#8217;d
especially recognize that hand with the scar!
That&#8217;s a dead giveaway!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The newcomer glanced quickly at his right
hand, which Jimmie had indicated. As he
brought it up to view, the boys could see
a jagged scar running clear across the back.
They had seen such a scar before.
</p>
<p>With an accusing finger pointing at the disfigurement,
Jimmie snapped out in crisp accents
that indicated plainly his excitement:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the same hand that tied and gagged
me in the warehouse in Amsterdam, and the
same hand that I saw shoved into the window
of the frontier hut to get the &#8216;U-13&#8217; package.
Deny it if you can!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not going to deny anything, you
know!&#8221; returned the other coolly. &#8220;You seem
so positive about it there&#8217;s little use denying!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet there&#8217;s no use denying anything
like that!&#8221; declared Jimmie with some heat.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t deny that you tried to sic the
German torpedo boat destroyer onto us, either.
You can&#8217;t deny that you sneaked away from
this very submarine when I was painting the
name on the bow. You&#8217;d better not try to
deny that you showed us to the British gunboat
a while ago and got them to fire at us. If
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
you start denying anything,&#8221; the boy went on,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to deny that I&#8217;m neutral!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a laugh the newcomer threw back his
head in amused fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have your own way about it, you know,&#8221;
he replied, &#8220;but I&#8217;m going to tell you one
thing. I&#8217;m not Mackinder!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>A MYSTERIOUS CRAFT</h3>
</div>

<p>The surprise of the lads at this declaration
of their visitor was profound. They stared at
the stranger who bore such a striking resemblance
to Mackinder and who had just declared
that he was not that person. Speechless
at the apparent untruth, they could only
stare.
</p>
<p>Seeing their looks of astonishment at his
declaration, the man laughed loudly, apparently
enjoying hugely the joke that the boys
could not see. Supporting himself against the
rail, he gave vent to peals of merriment at the
expense of the five young lads.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you don&#8217;t believe me, eh?&#8221; he inquired
at length, controlling himself with an effort.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t blame you, don&#8217;t you know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mackinder, you ought to be in vaudeville!&#8221;
declared Jimmie in reply. &#8220;For a
lightning change artist, you&#8217;re decidedly it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; acknowledged Mackinder,
choosing to accept the boy&#8217;s words as a compliment.
&#8220;You&#8217;re almost too kind, don&#8217;t you
know!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; the boy went on, &#8220;as a monologue
artist, you&#8217;d certainly have them all
backed off the boards. I know a place in New
York where you could draw down your two
fifty per without half trying!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An engagement, do you mean?&#8221; queried
the man, with interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that!&#8221; stated Jimmie. &#8220;And then,
there&#8217;s another place up the Hudson a ways
where you ought to be making little ones out
of big ones. They give a fellow a long engagement
there and supply costumes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All of which means that you&#8217;re spoofing
me a bit, don&#8217;t you know!&#8221; returned their visitor
without resentment. He was apparently
enjoying the situation hugely, and meant to
make the most of it.
</p>
<p>Seeing that his words failed to arouse or
draw out the other, Jimmie turned disgustedly
away to lean over the rail.
</p>
<p>Ned began to question their guest, but was
interrupted by Jimmie, who announced that
he saw a steamer&#8217;s smoke on the horizon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This water is quite thickly sprinkled with
vessels of all sorts,&#8221; said the alleged Mackinder.
&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;d better get out, you
know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make that vessel out to be?&#8221;
asked Ned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any difference what it is,&#8221;
replied the other, &#8220;we shall be better off if
they don&#8217;t find us! We don&#8217;t need them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; put in Jimmie, &#8220;then we&#8217;ll
get up steam on this wagon and slide along.
I&#8217;m going to say this to you, though, that
Mackinder or no Mackinder, we&#8217;re very grateful
for your help. If we get an opportunity
to reciprocate, we&#8217;ll be only too glad to do it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With this, the boy turned and offered his
hand to the man. It was grasped with a hearty
grip that conveyed a sense of friendliness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can help me right now,&#8221; was the response.
&#8220;Come aboard my vessel and give
me a hand on a little project I have under
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d better do that right
now,&#8221; stated Jimmie. &#8220;You see, we&#8217;re neutral,
and we don&#8217;t want to take sides either
way!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I neutral! I care nothing for this
awful war except to see it stop. I shall do
nothing for either side, so rest easy on that
score. But your propellor is broken by having
that line jammed in it. You cannot navigate
your vessel, and would better come aboard
mine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Doubting this statement, Jimmie clambered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
into the small boat and sculled toward the
stern of the false &#8220;U-13&#8221;. There he could look
into the water to a depth sufficient to confirm
the other&#8217;s statement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, boys,&#8221; he declared, returning
to the conning tower. &#8220;The blades of the propellor
are damaged beyond use. We might as
well go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Securing a line to the bow of the false &#8220;U-13&#8221;
the man proposed to tow it to a safe place
where it could be anchored to await repairs.
Two trips were necessary to transfer the boys
to the craft which had been of such signal service
in their hour of extreme need.
</p>
<p>Led by their recent guest, who was now
their host, the lads descended into the interior
of the vessel. Here a strange sight met their
gaze. In cages canaries were twittering gaily
while all about the bulkheads had been fastened
pots of plants, some of which were in
bloom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I understand why the air you so kindly
pumped into our vessel had the odor of
flowers and growing things!&#8221; declared Ned as
he turned to their host. &#8220;You have things
fixed pretty cozy here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a touch now and again to make it look
home-like!&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I prefer the sight
of a flower to that of a cold steel bulkhead.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Besides, it&#8217;s more healthful to have a few
plants about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harry was lost in admiration of the machinery
which he declared to be far superior
to that of the vessel they had lately abandoned.
</p>
<p>With a touch their strange host sent the
craft forward at a good speed. He explained
to the lads a gyroscope arrangement by which
he controlled the steering gear that kept the
vessel on any chosen course and at any desired
depth after once being adjusted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, if you please, Mr. Mackinder,&#8221;
questioned Jimmie at length, &#8220;will you be so
good as to tell us what your mission may be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221; replied the other frankly. &#8220;I
see the steamer is not following us so I will
take plenty of time to give you details.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; drily responded the lad. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
appreciate it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a laugh the man seated himself on a
locker and motioned the lads to do likewise.
They listened intently as he proceeded:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You perhaps all realize that the possession
of wealth is the desire of almost every
human being. I am not different from the
rest in that respect at least. Owing to some
family trouble which I shall not at this time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
detail, I was not given the advantages that
accrue ordinarily to heirs. I think you will
understand what I mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were left out in the cold when they
passed the dough?&#8221; asked Jimmie with a
knowing look. &#8220;Just shoved one side?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about it!&#8221; replied the man. &#8220;But I
resolved to get some money, nevertheless. I
had a fertile imagination, some education and
a very small amount of money. I did not want
to take so cheap a way as to rob or cheat my
fellow men. I was not shrewd enough to enter
the business world. Therefore, I turned my
attention to lost or buried treasure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jimmie delivered a broad wink toward Ned.
It was not lost by their observant entertainer,
who laughed much to the boy&#8217;s confusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Amongst other inventions that were in
my brain was an instrument for detecting the
presence of gold similar to the instrument
called a compass. In this instance electricity
had nothing to do with its action.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To make a long story short, you know, I
finally succeeded in perfecting the arrangement.
It was an amusing circumstance that
I had a very hard struggle preserving my last
gold piece with which to test the device,&#8221; he
went on with a laugh at the recollection of his
trials.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;At last, I thought I had my instrument
perfected. I next needed only something on
which to practice. With my precious treasure
carefully guarded I succeeded in reaching the
Gulf of Mexico, where it is said so much pirate
gold has been buried. Wonderful to relate, I
actually located and recovered a small amount.
It was not large but helped me to fit out a vessel
in which to make other cruises.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it really worked?&#8221; inquired Jimmie
in a tone of unbelief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How well I shall presently demonstrate,
you know,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;But I found that
the crew was tricky. They helped me get a
treasure aboard then calmly turned pirates
themselves and ran away with the treasure.
For nearly a year I had hard luck. Then I
succeeded in locating a large sum of gold that
had been buried by a man&#8217;s grandfather.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My past experiences had taught me that
I could not trust anyone. Therefore I determined
to prosecute my search in other channels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Piece by piece in different shops I had
this vessel constructed after my own designs.
The pieces were assembled in a part of the
Gulf of Mexico little frequented. There I
tried out the undersea boat, named it the
&#8216;U-13&#8217;&mdash;the &#8216;U&#8217; standing for Undersea and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
the &#8216;13&#8217; in defiance of the popular superstition.
But I found a new difficulty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The instrument, although working perfectly
on land, was not reliable under the
ocean, for as you know there is a large
amount of suspended gold in sea water. That
made the instrument unreliable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you want to go under water for,
anyway?&#8221; asked Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gold!&#8221; was the curt reply. &#8220;So I had to
construct another device that would neutralize
the local attraction of the sea water just
on the same principle that the mariner has the
two iron balls near his compass to overcome
the local attraction on his vessel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I was prepared to pursue my quest
for treasure undisturbed. My first venture
was the recovery of a large sum from a sunken
ship in Havana harbor. This provided me sufficient
funds so that I put stores aboard and
came across to seek for the vessels of the
Spanish Armada.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get across the Atlantic?&#8221;
asked Jimmie incredulously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this vessel!&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;And most
of the way under water, too, you know! I
didn&#8217;t want anyone to see me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you had to come up once in a while
to get air!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Here is a contrivance,&#8221; indicating
a huge box-like affair, &#8220;with which I separate
the oxygen from the hydrogen by electricity.
Water, as you know, is composed of
two gases&mdash;oxygen and hydrogen. Two atoms
of hydrogen combined with one atom of oxygen
and make a tiny bit of water. By the
aid of this special device I segregate the two
gases, use the oxygen and discharge the hydrogen
overboard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take my hat off to you!&#8221; declared
Jimmie. &#8220;But you had to have some
means to prevent discomfort from the storage
batteries!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with these!&#8221; smiled the other. &#8220;I&#8217;m
using, without permission, of course, a new
storage battery that does away with the lead-sulphuric
acid type of battery. The inventor
is a man whose name is familiar to you all.
He uses a nickel, iron oxide and steel combination
in a solution of potash. This battery,
instead of causing inflammation or even proving
deadly as is the case with the old type,
is actually a benefit to a person. It is exactly
opposite in its effect to the old style.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you manage to make a cruise of days
and days under water?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely!&#8221; smiled their host. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing to prevent it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going some!&#8221; declared Jimmie.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe you managed to dig up a
lot of gold from the bottom of the ocean!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is there to hinder?&#8221; questioned the
other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything!&#8221; declared Jimmie. &#8220;In the
first place there is all the water about. Then,
too, it would be easier to take this instrument
into the regions where gold is usually discovered
on land. You could prospect with it in
almost the positive knowledge that you would
locate a vein. Digging then would be easy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t like to dig!&#8221; laughed the
other. &#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;m too lazy to do that sort
of thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something queer here that I don&#8217;t
quite get,&#8221; stated Jimmie. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you explain
a little more in detail?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly, I&#8217;ll be glad to elucidate!&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;You have in mind the securing
of free gold in nuggets and dust. I go
about it in quite another way. My purpose is
to recover the minted coins that have been
placed aboard ships. When the ships sink, no
diver yet has been able to reach those in deep
water. Therefore, most of the gold that has
been carried to the bottom in sunken vessels
is forever lost. I intend to recover a great
deal of it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then when you know approximately
where the vessel was wrecked or sunk,&#8221; put
in Ned, &#8220;you go to that neighborhood. Your
instrument indicates the presence of gold and
you follow its directions until the exact spot
is reached. Then you step out and carry the
money aboard your own craft. Is that the correct
explanation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have it exactly. And I have done
pretty well so far!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; declared Jimmie flatly.
&#8220;The whole thing sounds mighty fishy&mdash;not
meaning any disrespect,&#8221; he added addressing
the man who sat leaning back against a bulkhead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I assure you that what I have said is
absolutely true!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from Missouri!&#8221; stated Jimmie in a
tone of doubt.
</p>
<p>Their host stepped to a locker which he
opened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Frozen Hot Boxes!&#8221; cried Jimmie.

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>A MYSTERY EXPLAINED</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Why, boys, look at this!&#8221; cried Jimmie,
his voice rising to a shriek then trailing off into
a whisper. &#8220;Did you ever see the like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see!&#8221; put in Frank, crowding forward.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eagerly the boys gathered around the open
compartment. They heard distinctly the tinkle
of coins as Jimmie seized a handful and let
them slip one by one back into place. Again
and again the boy dived his hands into the
yellow mass of metal. He raised handfuls of
coin to look at them a moment, then let them
drop from his grasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Night!&#8221; he ejaculated at length,
turning a round-eyed face to the man who
stood smiling beside the group. &#8220;Why, you
must have enough here to buy a farm and
build a fence clear around it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite likely I have!&#8221; declared the other
quietly. &#8220;But there are two or three other
wrecked vessels that I wish to visit before I
stop. I have the exact locations charted and
have examined the interiors.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you take the gold away with
you, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the very simple reason that I found
one pair of hands not enough to perform the
task. I could have taken the gold away from
the sunken wrecks, but the matter of getting
it ashore was another thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s to prevent?&#8221; asked Ned wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Several things!&#8221; declared the other. &#8220;In
the first place the peculiar phase of human nature
that makes every man mad when he sees
a lot of money would operate against my plan
of taking the gold ashore. Who could I hire
to move the heavy stuff with any assurance
of their honesty if they once found out what
might be in the packages?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so!&#8221; admitted Ned thoughtfully.
&#8220;Human nature is crooked!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My plan has been to find some one who
needs the money and who would work on a
percentage basis&mdash;share and share alike. We
can then get the money ashore, negotiate the
older coins that possess more than their face
value, bank the current coins and be prepared
to use the wealth exactly as we see fit. So
long as it remains under water it is safe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t understand how you get it
aboard!&#8221; declared Jimmie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have a tank of compressed air fixed to
the back of a special diving suit,&#8221; explained
the man. &#8220;There&#8217;s also a search light and a
small storage battery provided. In this suit I
step out through the air lock onto the wreck.
The rest is easy. I return with the load of
gold the same way I went out. The submarine
is anchored. The whole thing is simple!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmie. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t I remember our arrangement on the Sea
Lion? And then, too, we saw you walking
about on the decks of the Wanderer! I guess
I&#8217;m going daffy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say, boys, will you join the
expedition?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t stand much chance of getting
home right away,&#8221; stated Ned. &#8220;I guess we
might as well&mdash;&#8221; what he would say was cut
short by the sound of a cannon shot booming
through the gathering darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; inquired Jack anxiously,
jumping to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s that bloomin&#8217; steamer we
saw!&#8221; cried Jimmie. &#8220;That must be another
of those gun boats and they&#8217;re chasing us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go up to the deck and see!&#8221; offered
Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful, don&#8217;t let them get you!&#8221;
warned Jack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll watch out for that,&#8221; laughed Ned,
mounting the iron ladder.
</p>
<p>Directly the little group at the foot of the
ladder were startled to hear their companion&#8217;s
voice. A note of anxiety vibrated through his
words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; Ned cried, &#8220;there&#8217;s a gunboat out
there, and I think I see another submarine.
It looks to be like the &#8216;U-13&#8217; for all the world.
What shall we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; urged Jimmie, &#8220;take the glasses
and have a good look. If it is that Dutchman,
I&#8217;m for beating it out of here mighty quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a tense moment Ned gazed through the
glasses at the strange vessels. At length he
lowered the binoculars and turned toward his
companions. With a shake of his head and a
quick indrawing of breath, he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the &#8216;U-13&#8217; as sure as can be!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221; was Jimmie&#8217;s only comment as
he turned toward the switchboard with outstretched
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you!&#8221; declared Ned, quickly descending
the ladder to join the group. &#8220;Go
ahead slow, though. Don&#8217;t break the hawser,
or we&#8217;d lose the other vessel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we would do better to abandon
your vessel,&#8221; Mackinder suggested as he prepared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
to go on deck. &#8220;Let me have the glasses,
if you please. I&#8217;ll look them over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jimmie paused, with his hand on the starting
switch.
</p>
<p>Suddenly all were startled by a cry from
their host.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead! go ahead!&#8221; he shouted down
the hatchway. &#8220;That other fellow has
launched a torpedo at us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go the line, then!&#8221; urged Ned. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
have to run for it! Full speed, Jimmie!&#8221; he
added.
</p>
<p>Mackinder was casting off the hawser with
rapid motions. Jimmie, in response to Ned&#8217;s
command, threw the switch over. The &#8220;U-13&#8221;
began to gather headway.
</p>
<p>All were startled to hear the report of a
cannon shot. This was followed almost instantly
by a shriek from the man on deck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinder&#8217;s hit!&#8221; gasped Ned, turning a
blanched face to his chums. &#8220;What shall we
do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As if in answer to his query, the voice of
Mackinder reached the ears of the lads.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring an axe!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I&#8217;m fast in
the bight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wrenching an axe from its pocket on the
bulkhead, Ned sprang up the ladder at his
best speed. On deck he found Mackinder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
caught in a bight of the hawser by which the
other vessel had been towed. His leg was
jammed against the fairleader. Only one
glance was required to show the boy that serious
injury had been done.
</p>
<p>Without waiting for words, the lad stepped
to the side of the fallen man. Swinging his
axe quickly, he struck at the taut bond of hemp.
A shower of sparks followed the ringing thud
of the axe upon the steel deck.
</p>
<p>Mackinder dropped back upon the deck,
limp and helpless, as the singing of the parted
line told of his release.
</p>
<p>With tender solicitude the boys mounted the
ladder to assist their injured friend to the room
below. Scarcely had the boys gained the deck
when they were startled by a terrific explosion.
As Ned afterward declared, it seemed as if
they had been caught in a volcano of water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; queried Jack, releasing
his hold upon Mackinder.
</p>
<p>A flood of sea water descending upon the
little deck prevented an answer to his question.
In a moment the lads were able to look about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s our &#8216;U-13&#8217;?&#8221; asked Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221; stated Ned, his voice trembling.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet that German torpedoed it! I&#8217;m glad
we are on this &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>Echoing this sentiment, the lads hastily proceeded
to lower Mackinder through the hatchway.
This done, the injured man was deposited
on a couch, the hatch was closed, and Ned
began first-aid ministrations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What course shall I hold?&#8221; asked Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better head on a southwest course,&#8221; stated
Ned, briefly glancing up from his work over
Mackinder&#8217;s leg.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do that all right,&#8221; responded Jimmie.
&#8220;The gunboat and the submarine can fight it
out alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a clear field, Jimmie, so shove
the little wagon along for all she&#8217;s worth,&#8221; put
in Jack.
</p>
<p>Mackinder had been exercising wonderful
command of himself, but in spite of his best
efforts a groan now and again escaped. The
injured leg was proving a painful matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do all we can for you, Mackinder,&#8221;
Ned offered, &#8220;but we need better skill than is
available here. Would it not be best to make
at once for some port where we can secure the
services of a surgeon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mackinder&#8217;s only reply was a nod. His
teeth were closed tightly to suppress the cry
of anguish from his hurt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep on the surface, boys,&#8221; urged Ned as
he went about making the man comfortable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
with such simple means as were at hand. &#8220;I
believe we are not far from the coast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Surrendering the wheel to Frank, and with
Jack at the engines, Jimmie insisted upon
mounting to the deck again to look about them.
</p>
<p>Cool and sweet the air gushed down the little
open hatchway upon the injured man. Under
its influence and aided by the ministrations of
Ned, the proprietor of the third &#8220;U-13&#8221; rapidly
gained control of himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Head west southwest,&#8221; he instructed Ned.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be mighty apt to find the mouth of the
Thames on that course. There are many places
I&#8217;d rather go, but you are right&mdash;we must
have a surgeon!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Giving the course to Harry, Ned proceeded
to do everything in his power to ease the hurt
of their friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On deck, there!&#8221; announced Jimmie presently,
his face at the hatchway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; answered Ned. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a light about a point off the port
bow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make it out to be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is a lighthouse!&#8221; declared
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Margate!&#8221; murmured Mackinder. &#8220;We
are safe enough now, but be careful about the
money, boys!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sail ho!&#8221; rang out Jimmie&#8217;s voice again.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>MORE MYSTERY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What do you see now, Jimmie?&#8221; asked
Ned anxiously, stepping to the foot of the
ladder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a small steamer coming up rapidly
from the starboard side,&#8221; replied the lookout.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;d better dive again,&#8221; suggested
Ned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, go on!&#8221; protested Jimmie. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the use of diving every time anything comes
along? We&#8217;re neutral!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are, yes,&#8221; agreed Ned, &#8220;but this &#8216;U-13&#8217;
name is not neutral, and if the steamer is an
English vessel they&#8217;ll probably not stop to ask
questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not swing a white light at &#8217;em, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea, too!&#8221; agreed Ned. &#8220;If
they seem to be heading toward us, just get a
white flag going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not showing any light at all,&#8221;
announced Jimmie. &#8220;They&#8217;re just sneaking
along like an express train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us know at once if anything happens,&#8221;
Ned responded, turning back to his patient.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>The boys had not long to wait.
</p>
<p>Out of the gathering darkness Jimmie saw
a burst of flame which lighted up a portion
of the approaching steamer. A bright flash in
a wave some distance in advance of the &#8220;U-13&#8221;
next attracted his attention. The sharp roar
of a cannon came to the ears of all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they shooting at us?&#8221; asked Ned, again
approaching the ladder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know!&#8221; Jimmie replied briefly. &#8220;I
saw the flash and heard the noise. There was
a splash some distance ahead of us in the water.
Maybe they can&#8217;t aim straight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ned mounted the rungs of the ladder without
further delay. He closed his eyes as he
did so, the better to accommodate his vision to
the change from the light below to the darkness
outside. In a moment he was peering in
the direction indicated by Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you make her out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;I can just see a sort
of thick place in the darkness. My eyes will
be all right soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they were shooting at us at
all!&#8221; commented Jimmie, musingly. &#8220;They
can&#8217;t see us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As if to disprove this statement, another
flash lighted up the forward portion of the
other vessel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>Ned grasped Jimmie&#8217;s arm and pointed
straight ahead.
</p>
<p>Skipping from wave to wave, throwing up a
fountain of spray from each, the shot from the
steamer plowed its way across the path of the
&#8220;U-13,&#8221; passing so close that the boys were
struck by the flying drops of water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That means that we are to stop!&#8221; declared
Ned. &#8220;Next time they&#8217;ll shoot <i>at</i> us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And hit us, too!&#8221; excitedly put in the other.
</p>
<p>Without waiting for orders from Ned, the
lad leaned over the coaming of the little hatch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut her off, Jack!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Back on
your engines. That guy thinks we are Germans!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack at once complied with the request, and
soon the &#8220;U-13&#8221; was gently rolling in the
trough of the sea.
</p>
<p>Frank sprang from the wheel to the ladder,
mounting to the deck just as a beam of
flame from a powerful searchlight aboard the
steamer swept the &#8220;U-13&#8221; from end to end.
</p>
<p>In the glare of the light the three boys stood
plainly visible. They could not, however, distinguish
the details of the other vessel because
of the flaming eye regarding them with unwinking
stare.
</p>
<p>For a few moments they stood close to each
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
other, uncertain what to do. At length a voice
hailed them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Submarine, ahoy! What vessel is that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell them our name?&#8221; asked Ned
anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; urged Jimmie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say &#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve seen it on the side, anyhow!&#8221;
scorned Frank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them think we&#8217;re Germans. Don&#8217;t
you see they&#8217;re English?&#8221; queried Jimmie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t signify they&#8217;re English, even if
they do speak the language,&#8221; returned Ned.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you answer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahoy, there!&#8221; came an impatient voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Steamer, ahoy!&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;We&#8217;re a
peaceful submarine manned by neutral noncombatants!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A likely yarn, indeed!&#8221; laughed the
stranger. &#8220;Stand by to receive a boat. I shall
send an officer aboard to investigate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Captain,&#8221; consented Ned. &#8220;Glad
to meet you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still standing under the unwinking eye of
the searchlight, the little group waited expectantly
for the arrival of the boarding party.
</p>
<p>A splash of oars preceded the boat which
soon shot out of the darkness.
</p>
<p>In another moment an officer in uniform had
mounted the little deck. Wonderingly he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
glanced about the group, now augmented by
the arrival of Jack and Harry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your commander?&#8221; he inquired
somewhat stiffly, addressing no one in particular.
</p>
<p>Indicating Ned, the boys silently waited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in charge of this vessel?&#8221; asked
the officer, with just a trace of amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am and I am not,&#8221; replied Ned, with
dignity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very enlightening, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; returned
the other. &#8220;But time is short, and I
must see the person who is in charge, and that
at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The owner is lying in the cabin with a
broken leg which he received as we were escaping
from a German submarine,&#8221; explained
Ned. &#8220;We boys are trying to get to some port
where we can secure the services of a surgeon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; exclaimed the officer, &#8220;escaping from
a German?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. They torpedoed another submarine
that we were towing, and in casting off
the towing line the gentleman below was caught
in the line. His leg is badly broken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this other person?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave us the name of Mackinder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A frown settled over the face of their questioner.
Stepping forward, with flashing eyes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
he addressed Ned in a low voice vibrant with
emotion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you have all the lies out of your
system,&#8221; he gritted, &#8220;we&#8217;ll listen to the real
story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the real story!&#8221; protested Ned.
&#8220;Step below, if you don&#8217;t believe me, and you
may see for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have already seen enough to discredit
such a wild yarn as that!&#8221; declared the other.
&#8220;Too many of our brave sailors have been
killed and set adrift by the &#8216;U-13.&#8217; Besides,
the man you mention is certainly not in the
cabin. I can swear to that. Now, will you
tell me the truth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Mister,&#8221; put in Jimmie, &#8220;suppose
you go fifty-fifty with us. Who are you, and
what right have you to stop us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A short laugh was the man&#8217;s only answer.
He turned to hail the vessel from which he
had just come.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE MYSTERY OF THE &#8220;U-13&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Ahoy!&#8221; his hail rang out over the waters.
&#8220;Send another boat aboard us. I will transfer
the crew of this vessel!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you will!&#8221; scornfully replied Jimmie.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll do a lot, you will. We have something
to say about that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am more astonished than I can say,&#8221; the
officer replied as he gazed at the lad. &#8220;I had
supposed that Boy Scouts would not under any
circumstances lend themselves to a project of
an unworthy character.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who has done all that?&#8221; bristled
Jimmie, wrinkling a freckled nose at the man.
&#8220;You&#8217;re taking a lot for granted, I must say!
Who are you, anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find out quickly enough!&#8221; was the
answer.
</p>
<p>Turning at the sound of approaching oars,
the officer quickly issued a few short commands.
</p>
<p>In obedience to his orders, the boys were
required to enter the small boat without even
an opportunity of going below.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dodson,&#8221; ordered the officer, &#8220;take a
couple of men and search the vessel for others.
We were informed there were but five, but
they may have confederates.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wonderingly the lads sat in the boat as they
were rowed across the intervening distance to
the steamer. Scarcely had they set foot on
deck before a line was passed to the submarine
and the vessel was under way, towing their
recent habitation.
</p>
<p>An orderly conducted the lads directly to
the cabin, where they were greeted by an officer
seated at the head of a table. He arose as they
entered and extended a hand to each.
</p>
<p>Motioning to seats, the officer again busied
himself with some papers on the table. For
some time the boys glanced expectantly at each
other, waiting for the officer to open the anticipated
conversation.
</p>
<p>Impatiently the boys waited, listening to the
regular throbbing of the steamer&#8217;s propellers
that told they were again under way.
</p>
<p>At length the silence was broken by the arrival
of an orderly. Saluting, he reported
briefly to the officer. A nod dismissed him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; began the officer in a kindly tone,
&#8220;we find ourselves rather puzzled by some mysterious
circumstances which we hope you can
explain. Will you assist us?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I assume from the looks of things aboard
that you are English,&#8221; answered Ned. &#8220;Am I
correct?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are. This is a scout vessel doing patrol
duty along the coast. In common with others,
we have been on the sharp lookout for a submarine
named &#8216;U-13,&#8217; which has been doing
considerable damage to our shipping. We capture
it without difficulty, to find it manned by
Boy Scouts instead of Germans, as we had
expected. Can you explain that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; laughed Ned. &#8220;That is easy. The
boat you have captured is owned by a private
individual named Mackinder, who has been
amusing himself in a perfectly innocent pastime.
He, like ourselves, is neutral, but unfortunately
has gotten into rather compromising
situations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinder?&#8221; repeated the officer, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; continued Ned. &#8220;He rescued us
from our disabled submarine. He is now
aboard his vessel with a broken leg.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had him brought aboard this vessel,
and find that his leg is really broken,&#8221; explained
the officer. &#8220;But,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;you have not quite explained your presence
on a submarine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is easy&mdash;&#8221; began Ned. He was interrupted
by a sign from the officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; the other said. &#8220;We will
have Mackinder in here, and perhaps he can
explain a little of the mystery himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At a command from the man two orderlies
approached. In a few moments the boys observed
four sailors bearing a mattress upon
which lay their late host.
</p>
<p>At the same moment a group approached
from the after part of the cabin. Glancing
from one group to the other, the boys rose to
their feet with exclamations of surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Great Frozen Hot Boxes!&#8221; cried
Jimmie. &#8220;How did you get here, Mackinder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A man from the small group behind the officer
stepped forward, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was picked up by the fishing boat you
probably saw when I swam away from the submarine
you captured. They transferred me
to this craft. We have since been looking for
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to see you, anyway,&#8221; returned
the lad. &#8220;But you couldn&#8217;t prevent
our leaving Holland, even if you did try good
and hard. Have you found that package yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The smile quickly faded from the face of the
other.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; he answered in a low voice.
&#8220;I find that you boys have gotten me into a
lot of trouble, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble?&#8221; puzzled Ned. &#8220;How have we
done that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By secreting that package,&#8221; explained
Mackinder. &#8220;You see, I was detailed to duty
on the Holland frontier. When I saw that
package, and knew that you had recently come
from the German lines, I assumed, of course,
that it contained information for the German
submarine that has been causing so much havoc
amongst the English shipping. Without waiting
for orders, I tried to follow you and gain
possession of the object. Now it seems I am
disobeying regulations by absenting myself
from my post of duty without leave. Further,
I was seen aboard or coming from a German
vessel. Hence circumstances look bad for me.
I&#8217;m due for a court martial as soon as we land
at Margate, which must be close aboard by
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All were startled to hear a groan escape the
man lying upon the mattress. He had raised
himself upon one elbow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Robert!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Not that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; gasped Mackinder. Soon the two
men were shaking hands at a great rate, tears
in their eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; Mackinder announced at length,
&#8220;I must introduce my brother Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had the pleasure of meeting the
gentleman,&#8221; stated Ned. &#8220;In fact, we owe our
lives to his kindness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, see here,&#8221; demanded Jimmie, stepping
forward, &#8220;this needs an explanation.
Which one of you fellows was at the little cabin
on the Holland border?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom Mackinder smiled, in spite of the pain
of his crushed leg. He turned his glance
toward his brother, whose hand he held.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We both were there, Jimmie,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
took the package from the window. You see,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;it contained plans of my submarine,
with which you are familiar. I tried
to sell the plans to Germany, but found they
had beaten me. So upon my return trip I
slipped the package into your baggage, thinking
to escape search and detention at the border.
I have it here now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he ceased speaking he drew from his
pocket the same flat package the boys had seen
before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Jimmie. &#8220;Now we can
explain how your brother came to be captured
by the Germans, and how under his direction
we stole the other &#8216;U-13&#8217; and escaped from
Helgoland.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If what you say is true, young man,&#8221; put
in the officer, &#8220;the anticipated court martial
may never convene.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can prove it!&#8221; protested Jimmie
vigorously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we have solved the Mystery of the
&#8216;U-13&#8217;!&#8221; declared the officer, with evident
relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now we&#8217;ll head for the little old U. S. A.
and peaceful neutrality!&#8221; was Jimmie&#8217;s joyful
comment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll first arrange to care for your
share of the cargo aboard my boat,&#8221; interposed
the injured Mackinder.
</p>
<p>He would not entertain any of the objections
raised by the boys, but insisted that they share
in the treasure which had been recovered from
the ocean&#8217;s grasp.
</p>
<p>A few days later as the boys watched the
chalk cliffs of Dover slip away into the eastern
horizon Jimmie turned from the rail of the
steamer upon which they had taken passage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good by, England, and good by the Mackinders,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we are out of
the war zone at last and that we solved the
Mystery of the &#8216;U-13&#8217;.&#8221;

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
